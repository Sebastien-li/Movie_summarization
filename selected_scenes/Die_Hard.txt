        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:

        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 No, sir.

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.

        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!

        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.

        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:

                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:

        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.

                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...

        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.

        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!

        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:

                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 (quietly)

                 We're both professionals.  But this

                 is personal.  You...are done.



        WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.

                 would like to say to them if they're

                 watching?



        John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.



                                 LUCY

                 Come home.

        She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her

        head, looks at Hans.



        HER P.O.V. - HANS                                    



        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.



                                 HANS

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!



                                 HANS

                 (shouting)

                 On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs,

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.

        McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                 scream when I broke his fucking

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.

                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.

        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO

        truck away from the loading dock.

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:

                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.

        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!
