INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING



Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is

beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.

Zoe opens her eyes.



After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts

up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out

as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.

EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER



Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.



                      STAN

            This is our basic chevre, probably

            our best seller. The cheese that

            started it all, as they say. Then

            over here we have our surface-

            ripened cheeses. These are the

            aged/raw milk cheeses.

            (realizing)

            This is really boring, huh?



                      ZOE

            No, not at all.



                      STAN

            It's like you're in a foreign

            country and the only thing to watch

            on tv is a documentary on cheese.

            You don't want to watch it, but

            somehow you can't stop...



                      ZOE

            (laughing)

            I think it's interesting.    Really.



                      STAN

            All right, you asked for it...

            (boring voice)

            The aged/raw milk cheeses are made

            from raw milk and then aged for

            four to six months. Sometimes

            more. Sometimes less. Usually

            more. Depends on the cheese.



                      FRED

            Stop.   You're killing me.



FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks

up from behind the counter.



                      STAN

            Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

            (then)

            She's the one I followed from the

            subway the other day like a total

            psychopath.



                      FRED

            Right...I heard about you.





                      ZOE

            I don't know whether to be

            flattered or terrified.



                      FRED

            Be afraid.



                      STAN

            Don't scare her away.   I'm trying

            to redeem myself.



                      FRED

            Then you should put down the banjo.

            You look like a doofus.



                      STAN

            Doofus?

            (then, to Zoe)

            Do you think I look like a doofus?



                      ZOE

            I don't really know what a doofus

            looks like.



Fred points to Stan.



                      STAN

            Okay. If I put the banjo down, can

            I take you to lunch or something?



                      ZOE

            I should really get back to work.



                      STAN

            Come on, say the word and we can

            have a six-course tasting menu at

            Union Square Cafe. I know the

            chef.



                      ZOE

            That sounds nice, but, I should

            probably go.



                      STAN

            Well, can I call you?



Zoe smiles.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================66====================
INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER



They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They

look happy and worn out



Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are

all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.



Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...



                      STAN

            That was amazing. I mean, like,

            totally and exceptionally, over-the-

            top, amazing.



Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.



                      ZOE

            Stan.



                      STAN

            Yeah.



                      ZOE

            There's something I really have to

            tell you.



                      STAN

            There's something I have to tell

            you, too.



Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Can I go first? `Cause if we're

            going to say the same thing, I want

            to say it first.



                      ZOE

            We're not going to say the same

            thing.





                      STAN

            Well, let me go, because this is

            really embarrassing, and I just

            have to say it.



                      ZOE

            Okay.



                      STAN

            I've dated a lot of women. I mean,

            not tons, but a lot. And, the

            thing is, I've never...been in love

            before. I've never even told

            anyone I love them before. Because

            I just never felt it. But from the

            day we met, from the first time our

            backs accidentally touched in the

            subway, I feel this, this...

            (he shakes his head)

            Maybe this is too much to say right

            now, but...I love you, Zoe. I

            really do.



Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares

at him.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            In my mind, you were supposed to

            say, I love you, too.



Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A

beat later, we hear her vomit.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY



The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their

usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.





                      LORI

            Make sure you put your numbers

            down. I want to have everyone's

            number handy in case I go into

            labor early.



Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.



                      ZOE

            Hi, guys.



No one knows what to say.



                      CAROL

            Hi, Zoe.



                      ZOE

            I just wanted to apologize. I'm

            sorry I got into a relationship and

            wasn't honest with you guys, and

            I'm sorry I interrupted you,

            Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing

            better.



                      TABITHA

            Thanks.



                      ZOE

            (to Carol)

            And I've thought a lot about what

            you said, about how lucky I am. I

            got into this whole situation

            because I wanted to have a baby.

            And, somehow, I lost sight of that.

            (then)

            Anyway, I need partners in this,

            and I hope you'll take me back.



Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's this?



                      LORI

            It's a phone tree. I'm due next

            month, but my midwife thinks I may

            go sooner. I want everyone to be

            there. Are you in?



Zoe smiles.



                      ZOE

            I'm in.





========================================

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT



Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the

closet.



                      STAN

            Everything okay in there?



A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Never mind.



He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.



                      ZOE (O.S.)

            This SUCKS!!!



                      STAN

            Honey, whatever you wear is fine.





                      ZOE (O.S.)

            I don't have anything to wear!

            That's the problem.



Another dress sails through the air.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuuuuuuck!



                      STAN

            You always look great. I've never

            seen you not look great.



Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black

dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            That's perfect. You look hot.



                      ZOE

            Really?    You think?



Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper

are ten inches apart.



                      STAN

            Do you have a shawl or something?



Zoe bursts into tears.



========================================
====================108====================
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY



Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She

runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over

and stands beside her.

INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY



Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.



                      NANA

            So, we'll put the band here and the

            dance floor right here.



                      ZOE

            I can't believe you're getting

            married. What made you change your

            mind?



                      NANA

            All of a sudden it just hit me,

            what am I waiting for? I love him.

            He loves me. What am I so afraid

            of?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   This is...really big news.



                      NANA

            You don't seem happy.



                      ZOE

            No, I am. It's just...it just

            makes my situation seem all the

            more tragic. You're getting

            married and here I am...





Her voice trails off.



                      NANA

            Zoe.



                      ZOE

            Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really

            happy for you.



                      NANA

            I'm worried about you, honey.



                      ZOE

            I'm fine.



                      NANA

            I just don't want you to make the

            same mistakes I made. I've been

            alone for over thirty years now,

            and that's too long. Sometimes in

            life you have to forgive and move

            on.



                      ZOE

            Are you talking about my father or

            Stan?



                      NANA

            Both, baby.

EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER



Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.



                      STAN

            This is our basic chevre, probably

            our best seller. The cheese that

            started it all, as they say. Then

            over here we have our surface-

            ripened cheeses. These are the

            aged/raw milk cheeses.

            (realizing)

            This is really boring, huh?



                      ZOE

            No, not at all.



                      STAN

            It's like you're in a foreign

            country and the only thing to watch

            on tv is a documentary on cheese.

            You don't want to watch it, but

            somehow you can't stop...



                      ZOE

            (laughing)

            I think it's interesting.    Really.



                      STAN

            All right, you asked for it...

            (boring voice)

            The aged/raw milk cheeses are made

            from raw milk and then aged for

            four to six months. Sometimes

            more. Sometimes less. Usually

            more. Depends on the cheese.



                      FRED

            Stop.   You're killing me.



FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks

up from behind the counter.



                      STAN

            Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

            (then)

            She's the one I followed from the

            subway the other day like a total

            psychopath.



                      FRED

            Right...I heard about you.





                      ZOE

            I don't know whether to be

            flattered or terrified.



                      FRED

            Be afraid.



                      STAN

            Don't scare her away.   I'm trying

            to redeem myself.



                      FRED

            Then you should put down the banjo.

            You look like a doofus.



                      STAN

            Doofus?

            (then, to Zoe)

            Do you think I look like a doofus?



                      ZOE

            I don't really know what a doofus

            looks like.



Fred points to Stan.



                      STAN

            Okay. If I put the banjo down, can

            I take you to lunch or something?



                      ZOE

            I should really get back to work.



                      STAN

            Come on, say the word and we can

            have a six-course tasting menu at

            Union Square Cafe. I know the

            chef.



                      ZOE

            That sounds nice, but, I should

            probably go.



                      STAN

            Well, can I call you?



Zoe smiles.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================66====================
INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER



They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They

look happy and worn out



Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are

all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.



Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...



                      STAN

            That was amazing. I mean, like,

            totally and exceptionally, over-the-

            top, amazing.



Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.



                      ZOE

            Stan.



                      STAN

            Yeah.



                      ZOE

            There's something I really have to

            tell you.



                      STAN

            There's something I have to tell

            you, too.



Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Can I go first? `Cause if we're

            going to say the same thing, I want

            to say it first.



                      ZOE

            We're not going to say the same

            thing.





                      STAN

            Well, let me go, because this is

            really embarrassing, and I just

            have to say it.



                      ZOE

            Okay.



                      STAN

            I've dated a lot of women. I mean,

            not tons, but a lot. And, the

            thing is, I've never...been in love

            before. I've never even told

            anyone I love them before. Because

            I just never felt it. But from the

            day we met, from the first time our

            backs accidentally touched in the

            subway, I feel this, this...

            (he shakes his head)

            Maybe this is too much to say right

            now, but...I love you, Zoe. I

            really do.



Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares

at him.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            In my mind, you were supposed to

            say, I love you, too.



Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A

beat later, we hear her vomit.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY



The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their

usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.





                      LORI

            Make sure you put your numbers

            down. I want to have everyone's

            number handy in case I go into

            labor early.



Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.



                      ZOE

            Hi, guys.



No one knows what to say.



                      CAROL

            Hi, Zoe.



                      ZOE

            I just wanted to apologize. I'm

            sorry I got into a relationship and

            wasn't honest with you guys, and

            I'm sorry I interrupted you,

            Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing

            better.



                      TABITHA

            Thanks.



                      ZOE

            (to Carol)

            And I've thought a lot about what

            you said, about how lucky I am. I

            got into this whole situation

            because I wanted to have a baby.

            And, somehow, I lost sight of that.

            (then)

            Anyway, I need partners in this,

            and I hope you'll take me back.



Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's this?



                      LORI

            It's a phone tree. I'm due next

            month, but my midwife thinks I may

            go sooner. I want everyone to be

            there. Are you in?



Zoe smiles.



                      ZOE

            I'm in.





========================================
====================89====================
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT



Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the

closet.



                      STAN

            Everything okay in there?



A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Never mind.



He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.



                      ZOE (O.S.)

            This SUCKS!!!



                      STAN

            Honey, whatever you wear is fine.





                      ZOE (O.S.)

            I don't have anything to wear!

            That's the problem.



Another dress sails through the air.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuuuuuuck!



                      STAN

            You always look great. I've never

            seen you not look great.



Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black

dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            That's perfect. You look hot.



                      ZOE

            Really?    You think?



Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper

are ten inches apart.



                      STAN

            Do you have a shawl or something?



Zoe bursts into tears.



========================================
====================108====================
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY



Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She

runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over

and stands beside her.



========================================

INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY



Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.



                      NANA

            So, we'll put the band here and the

            dance floor right here.



                      ZOE

            I can't believe you're getting

            married. What made you change your

            mind?



                      NANA

            All of a sudden it just hit me,

            what am I waiting for? I love him.

            He loves me. What am I so afraid

            of?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   This is...really big news.



                      NANA

            You don't seem happy.



                      ZOE

            No, I am. It's just...it just

            makes my situation seem all the

            more tragic. You're getting

            married and here I am...





Her voice trails off.



                      NANA

            Zoe.



                      ZOE

            Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really

            happy for you.



                      NANA

            I'm worried about you, honey.



                      ZOE

            I'm fine.



                      NANA

            I just don't want you to make the

            same mistakes I made. I've been

            alone for over thirty years now,

            and that's too long. Sometimes in

            life you have to forgive and move

            on.



                      ZOE

            Are you talking about my father or

            Stan?



                      NANA

            Both, baby.

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING



Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is

beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.

Zoe opens her eyes.



After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts

up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out

as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.





========================================

EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER



Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.



                      STAN

            This is our basic chevre, probably

            our best seller. The cheese that

            started it all, as they say. Then

            over here we have our surface-

            ripened cheeses. These are the

            aged/raw milk cheeses.

            (realizing)

            This is really boring, huh?



                      ZOE

            No, not at all.



                      STAN

            It's like you're in a foreign

            country and the only thing to watch

            on tv is a documentary on cheese.

            You don't want to watch it, but

            somehow you can't stop...



                      ZOE

            (laughing)

            I think it's interesting.    Really.



                      STAN

            All right, you asked for it...

            (boring voice)

            The aged/raw milk cheeses are made

            from raw milk and then aged for

            four to six months. Sometimes

            more. Sometimes less. Usually

            more. Depends on the cheese.



                      FRED

            Stop.   You're killing me.



FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks

up from behind the counter.



                      STAN

            Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

            (then)

            She's the one I followed from the

            subway the other day like a total

            psychopath.



                      FRED

            Right...I heard about you.





                      ZOE

            I don't know whether to be

            flattered or terrified.



                      FRED

            Be afraid.



                      STAN

            Don't scare her away.   I'm trying

            to redeem myself.



                      FRED

            Then you should put down the banjo.

            You look like a doofus.



                      STAN

            Doofus?

            (then, to Zoe)

            Do you think I look like a doofus?



                      ZOE

            I don't really know what a doofus

            looks like.



Fred points to Stan.



                      STAN

            Okay. If I put the banjo down, can

            I take you to lunch or something?



                      ZOE

            I should really get back to work.



                      STAN

            Come on, say the word and we can

            have a six-course tasting menu at

            Union Square Cafe. I know the

            chef.



                      ZOE

            That sounds nice, but, I should

            probably go.



                      STAN

            Well, can I call you?



Zoe smiles.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.

INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER



They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They

look happy and worn out



Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are

all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.



Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...



                      STAN

            That was amazing. I mean, like,

            totally and exceptionally, over-the-

            top, amazing.



Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.



                      ZOE

            Stan.



                      STAN

            Yeah.



                      ZOE

            There's something I really have to

            tell you.



                      STAN

            There's something I have to tell

            you, too.



Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Can I go first? `Cause if we're

            going to say the same thing, I want

            to say it first.



                      ZOE

            We're not going to say the same

            thing.





                      STAN

            Well, let me go, because this is

            really embarrassing, and I just

            have to say it.



                      ZOE

            Okay.



                      STAN

            I've dated a lot of women. I mean,

            not tons, but a lot. And, the

            thing is, I've never...been in love

            before. I've never even told

            anyone I love them before. Because

            I just never felt it. But from the

            day we met, from the first time our

            backs accidentally touched in the

            subway, I feel this, this...

            (he shakes his head)

            Maybe this is too much to say right

            now, but...I love you, Zoe. I

            really do.



Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares

at him.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            In my mind, you were supposed to

            say, I love you, too.



Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A

beat later, we hear her vomit.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY



The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their

usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.





                      LORI

            Make sure you put your numbers

            down. I want to have everyone's

            number handy in case I go into

            labor early.



Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.



                      ZOE

            Hi, guys.



No one knows what to say.



                      CAROL

            Hi, Zoe.



                      ZOE

            I just wanted to apologize. I'm

            sorry I got into a relationship and

            wasn't honest with you guys, and

            I'm sorry I interrupted you,

            Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing

            better.



                      TABITHA

            Thanks.



                      ZOE

            (to Carol)

            And I've thought a lot about what

            you said, about how lucky I am. I

            got into this whole situation

            because I wanted to have a baby.

            And, somehow, I lost sight of that.

            (then)

            Anyway, I need partners in this,

            and I hope you'll take me back.



Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's this?



                      LORI

            It's a phone tree. I'm due next

            month, but my midwife thinks I may

            go sooner. I want everyone to be

            there. Are you in?



Zoe smiles.



                      ZOE

            I'm in.





========================================

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT



Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the

closet.



                      STAN

            Everything okay in there?



A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Never mind.



He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.



                      ZOE (O.S.)

            This SUCKS!!!



                      STAN

            Honey, whatever you wear is fine.





                      ZOE (O.S.)

            I don't have anything to wear!

            That's the problem.



Another dress sails through the air.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuuuuuuck!



                      STAN

            You always look great. I've never

            seen you not look great.



Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black

dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            That's perfect. You look hot.



                      ZOE

            Really?    You think?



Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper

are ten inches apart.



                      STAN

            Do you have a shawl or something?



Zoe bursts into tears.



========================================
====================108====================
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY



Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She

runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over

and stands beside her.



========================================
====================114====================
INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY



Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.



                      NANA

            So, we'll put the band here and the

            dance floor right here.



                      ZOE

            I can't believe you're getting

            married. What made you change your

            mind?



                      NANA

            All of a sudden it just hit me,

            what am I waiting for? I love him.

            He loves me. What am I so afraid

            of?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   This is...really big news.



                      NANA

            You don't seem happy.



                      ZOE

            No, I am. It's just...it just

            makes my situation seem all the

            more tragic. You're getting

            married and here I am...





Her voice trails off.



                      NANA

            Zoe.



                      ZOE

            Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really

            happy for you.



                      NANA

            I'm worried about you, honey.



                      ZOE

            I'm fine.



                      NANA

            I just don't want you to make the

            same mistakes I made. I've been

            alone for over thirty years now,

            and that's too long. Sometimes in

            life you have to forgive and move

            on.



                      ZOE

            Are you talking about my father or

            Stan?



                      NANA

            Both, baby.



========================================

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING



Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is

beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.

Zoe opens her eyes.



After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts

up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out

as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.





========================================
====================21====================
EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER



Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.



                      STAN

            This is our basic chevre, probably

            our best seller. The cheese that

            started it all, as they say. Then

            over here we have our surface-

            ripened cheeses. These are the

            aged/raw milk cheeses.

            (realizing)

            This is really boring, huh?



                      ZOE

            No, not at all.



                      STAN

            It's like you're in a foreign

            country and the only thing to watch

            on tv is a documentary on cheese.

            You don't want to watch it, but

            somehow you can't stop...



                      ZOE

            (laughing)

            I think it's interesting.    Really.



                      STAN

            All right, you asked for it...

            (boring voice)

            The aged/raw milk cheeses are made

            from raw milk and then aged for

            four to six months. Sometimes

            more. Sometimes less. Usually

            more. Depends on the cheese.



                      FRED

            Stop.   You're killing me.



FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks

up from behind the counter.



                      STAN

            Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

            (then)

            She's the one I followed from the

            subway the other day like a total

            psychopath.



                      FRED

            Right...I heard about you.





                      ZOE

            I don't know whether to be

            flattered or terrified.



                      FRED

            Be afraid.



                      STAN

            Don't scare her away.   I'm trying

            to redeem myself.



                      FRED

            Then you should put down the banjo.

            You look like a doofus.



                      STAN

            Doofus?

            (then, to Zoe)

            Do you think I look like a doofus?



                      ZOE

            I don't really know what a doofus

            looks like.



Fred points to Stan.



                      STAN

            Okay. If I put the banjo down, can

            I take you to lunch or something?



                      ZOE

            I should really get back to work.



                      STAN

            Come on, say the word and we can

            have a six-course tasting menu at

            Union Square Cafe. I know the

            chef.



                      ZOE

            That sounds nice, but, I should

            probably go.



                      STAN

            Well, can I call you?



Zoe smiles.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================66====================
INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER



They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They

look happy and worn out



Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are

all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.



Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...



                      STAN

            That was amazing. I mean, like,

            totally and exceptionally, over-the-

            top, amazing.



Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.



                      ZOE

            Stan.



                      STAN

            Yeah.



                      ZOE

            There's something I really have to

            tell you.



                      STAN

            There's something I have to tell

            you, too.



Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Can I go first? `Cause if we're

            going to say the same thing, I want

            to say it first.



                      ZOE

            We're not going to say the same

            thing.





                      STAN

            Well, let me go, because this is

            really embarrassing, and I just

            have to say it.



                      ZOE

            Okay.



                      STAN

            I've dated a lot of women. I mean,

            not tons, but a lot. And, the

            thing is, I've never...been in love

            before. I've never even told

            anyone I love them before. Because

            I just never felt it. But from the

            day we met, from the first time our

            backs accidentally touched in the

            subway, I feel this, this...

            (he shakes his head)

            Maybe this is too much to say right

            now, but...I love you, Zoe. I

            really do.



Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares

at him.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            In my mind, you were supposed to

            say, I love you, too.



Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A

beat later, we hear her vomit.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY



The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their

usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.





                      LORI

            Make sure you put your numbers

            down. I want to have everyone's

            number handy in case I go into

            labor early.



Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.



                      ZOE

            Hi, guys.



No one knows what to say.



                      CAROL

            Hi, Zoe.



                      ZOE

            I just wanted to apologize. I'm

            sorry I got into a relationship and

            wasn't honest with you guys, and

            I'm sorry I interrupted you,

            Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing

            better.



                      TABITHA

            Thanks.



                      ZOE

            (to Carol)

            And I've thought a lot about what

            you said, about how lucky I am. I

            got into this whole situation

            because I wanted to have a baby.

            And, somehow, I lost sight of that.

            (then)

            Anyway, I need partners in this,

            and I hope you'll take me back.



Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's this?



                      LORI

            It's a phone tree. I'm due next

            month, but my midwife thinks I may

            go sooner. I want everyone to be

            there. Are you in?



Zoe smiles.



                      ZOE

            I'm in.

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT



Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the

closet.



                      STAN

            Everything okay in there?



A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Never mind.



He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.



                      ZOE (O.S.)

            This SUCKS!!!



                      STAN

            Honey, whatever you wear is fine.





                      ZOE (O.S.)

            I don't have anything to wear!

            That's the problem.



Another dress sails through the air.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuuuuuuck!



                      STAN

            You always look great. I've never

            seen you not look great.



Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black

dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            That's perfect. You look hot.



                      ZOE

            Really?    You think?



Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper

are ten inches apart.



                      STAN

            Do you have a shawl or something?



Zoe bursts into tears.



========================================
====================108====================
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY



Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She

runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over

and stands beside her.



========================================

INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY



Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.



                      NANA

            So, we'll put the band here and the

            dance floor right here.



                      ZOE

            I can't believe you're getting

            married. What made you change your

            mind?



                      NANA

            All of a sudden it just hit me,

            what am I waiting for? I love him.

            He loves me. What am I so afraid

            of?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   This is...really big news.



                      NANA

            You don't seem happy.



                      ZOE

            No, I am. It's just...it just

            makes my situation seem all the

            more tragic. You're getting

            married and here I am...





Her voice trails off.



                      NANA

            Zoe.



                      ZOE

            Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really

            happy for you.



                      NANA

            I'm worried about you, honey.



                      ZOE

            I'm fine.



                      NANA

            I just don't want you to make the

            same mistakes I made. I've been

            alone for over thirty years now,

            and that's too long. Sometimes in

            life you have to forgive and move

            on.



                      ZOE

            Are you talking about my father or

            Stan?



                      NANA

            Both, baby.
