     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.

                    How d'you know he's cheating?

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.

                    Crazy chutiy√©.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.

     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.

     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.

                    Crazy chutiy√©.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

====================51====================
     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiy√©.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     smiling, but disorientated.

     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.

     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiy√©.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs
