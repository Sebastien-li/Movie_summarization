               (FLASHBACK)



               We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering: he's 

               comically wide-eyed with shock.

               :SC: INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



               Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening 

               to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.



               He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep 

               yearbook.



               We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white 

               YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 

               message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with 

                         motion lotion. Just kidding (kind 

                         of.) Your best friend, Juno.



               Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE 

               Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.



               There's a knock on the bedroom door.



               BLEEKER'S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         Paul? Are you coming downstairs to 

                         eat?



                                     BLEEKER

                         I don't think so.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         You ran eight miles today, Puppy.



                                     BLEEKER

                         I'm not hungry, oddly.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         But it's breakfast for supper. Your 

                         favorite, Paulie. I made French toast 

                         and sausage. Patties, not linkies, 

                         just like you like it.



               Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         Juno MacGuff called while you were 

                         out running. She wants to know if 

                         you're coming to her little 

                         coffeehouse performance on Saturday.



                                     BLEEKER

                         Thanks for the message.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         You know how I feel about her.



                                     BLEEKER

                         You've mentioned it about fifty times.



                                     BLEEKER'S MOM

                         I just hope you don't consider her a 

                         close friend.



               Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.



               We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one 

               hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Can I take your coats?



                                     JUNO

                         Sure.



               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 

               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.



                                     JUNO

                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 

                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 

                         other people with the fake woods in 

                         the background. Like I'm really going 

                         to fall for that, you know?



                                     VANESSA

                         You found us in the Penny Saver?



               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 

               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.



               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 

               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.



                                     MARK

                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to 

                         see you up here.



                                     MARK

                         Sorry. I was just getting something.



                                     JUNO

                         Did your wife send you up here to 

                         spy on me?



                                     MARK

                         What? No! Do we come off like paranoid 

                         yuppies or something?



                                     JUNO

                         Well, you don't just invite a random 

                         pregnant teenager into your house 

                         and leave her unsupervised. I could 

                         be a total klepto, for all you know.



                                     MARK

                         I don't get a klepto vibe from you. 

                         Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't 

                         rule it out.



                                     JUNO

                         I did steal a squirt of perfume. 

                         What do you think? It's Clinique 

                         Happy.



               She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils.



                                     JUNO

                         Smell those sparkling topnotes!



               Mark inhales.



                                     MARK

                         Am I supposed to feel happy now?



                                     JUNO

                         You should be happy, Holmes. I'm 

                         giving you and Vanessa the gift of 

                         life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! 

                         And you don't even have to be there 

                         when the baby comes out of me all 

                         covered in...

                         We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.



               Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently.



                                     JUNO

                         (halting)

                         Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul?



               Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We 

               see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.



                                     MARK

                         Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa 

                         lets me have a room for all my old 

                         stuff.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, you get a whole room in your 

                         own house? She's got you on a long 

                         leash there, Mark.



                                     MARK

                         Shut up.

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 

               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 

               grin.



                                     MARK

                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.

                         (furtive)

                         Is Vanessa here?



                                     MARK

                         Nope. We're safe.



               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.



                                     JUNO

                         Cool.



                                     MARK

                         Come on, I have something for you.



               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 

               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 

               to illuminate a bare bulb.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 

                         It's beautiful!

                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 

                         old comics down here, and I want to 

                         show you one of them.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...



                                     MARK

                         You're gonna like this, I promise.



               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.



                                     MARK

                         (extracting a bagged 

                         COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                         (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                         (growing)

                         No.



                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.



                                     MARK

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...



                                     JUNO

                         (interrupting)

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 

                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 

                         else's family. Listen, once I have 

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!



                                     MARK

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.



                                     JUNO

                         (aghast)

                         But you're old!



                                     MARK

                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 

                         Why are you here?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.



                                     MARK

                         This...

                         (he gestures to the 

                         dank surrounding 

                         room)

                         ...this is what my life has become. 

                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 

                         Is that so appealing to you?



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         God, you're so young.



                                     JUNO

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

               :SC: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY



               A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 

               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.



               The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.



                                     NURSE

                         Would you like to meet your son?



               Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, 

               paralyzed, several feet away.



                                     VANESSA

                         I have a son?



                                     NURSE

                         (amused)

                         You are the adoptive mother?



                                     VANESSA

                         I have a son.



                                     NURSE

                         Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any 

                         time getting out.



               Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 

               her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.



               She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren 

               leaning against the doorway.



               Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.



                                     VANESSA

                         How do I look?



                                     BREN

                         (gently)

                         Like a mom. Scared shitless.



               Vanessa laughs.

               :SC: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING



               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her 

               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         I think he was always hers.

               :SC: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY



               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar 

               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not 

               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is 

                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my 

                         macaroni. I know people are supposed 

                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 

                         but normalcy's not really our style.



               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 

               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in 

               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.



               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning 

               his guitar.
