====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.



========================================

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

        is soft, comforting.

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.

        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================11====================
        INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                            



        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (surprised, actually feeling

                 tension decline)

                 Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



        Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

        shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                 What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's a long story.  You know, I

                 think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                 That's okay...

                 (pause)

                 ... I have an eye on his private

                 bathroom.



        McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

        to show any).

                                                                       



                                 HOLLY

                 So, where are you staying?  This                     

                 all happened so fast I didn't even

                 ask you on the phone.



        McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                 here a couple years ago.  He said I

                 could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                 Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                 Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                 whole time...Look, let's make this

                 easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                 not huge, but the kids would love to

                 have you at the house.



        McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                 They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                 (beat; honest)

                 I would too.

                                                                       

        They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

        says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



        Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

        door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

        retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

        tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                 ...I've missed you.                                  



                                 MCCLANE

                 Especially my name.  You must miss

                 it every time you write a check.  When

                 did you start calling yourself

                 'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                 (caught)

                 This is a Japanese company, you know?

                 They figure a married woman, she's on

                 the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                 this one particular married woman,

                 she went out the door so fast there

                 was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                 talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                 Didn't we have this same conversation

                 in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                 an opportunity out here -- I had to

                 take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                 My job and my title and my salary did

                 nothing to our marriage except change

                 your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                 'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                 I never should've let you get those

                 magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                 You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                 It's a partnership where people help

                 each other over the rough spots --

                 console each other when there's a

                 down...and when there's an up, well,

                 hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                 an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                 (quietly)

                 I needed that, John.

                 (pause)

                 I deserved that.



        There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

        say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                 Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                 for you...he wants you to say something

                 to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                 Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                 Oh, this is --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (mock bright 'radio' voice)

                 Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

                 sensitive and supportive man of the

                 eighties.



        Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

        door.



                                 HOLLY

                 I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't I always?



        She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to himself)

                 Schmuck!

        INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME                       



        The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his

        monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the

        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.  As

        they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear

        their conversation.



                                 MAN #1 (THEO)

                 (animatedly)

                 ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,

                 this is a great play -- feeds Worthy

                 on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,

                 back to Worthy in the lane and --



        Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a

        silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the

        Guard can react he pulls the trigger.



                                 THEO

                 (dryly)

                 Boom...two points.



        (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone

        for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the

        desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.



        His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock

        drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video

        monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his

        briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.



                                 THEO

                 We're in.



        ON THE SCREEN                                         



        the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of

        the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the

        service elevator.

        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================28====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                         



        Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone

        seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of

        Wagner.



                                 HANS

                 Nice suit.  John Philips...London?



        Takagi stares at him, speechless.



                                 HANS

                 (smiles)

                 I have two myself.

                 (beat, as he exits:)

                 I'm told Arafat shops there too...



========================================
====================30====================
        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT       



        Hands enters, looks around.                                      



                                 HANS                                    

                 And when Alexander saw the breadth

                 of his domain, he wept.  For there

                 were no more worlds to conquer.

                 (to Takagi)

                 The benefits of a classical education.



        Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are          

        photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

        Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.



                                 HANS

                 It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed

                 models as a boy.  The exactness, the

                 attention to every foreseeable detail...

                 perfection.



                                 TAKAGI

                 (defensively)

                 This is what this is about?  Out

                 building project in Indonesia?

                 Contrary to what you people think,

                 we're going to develop that region...

                 not 'exploit' it.



        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 I believe you.

                 (smiling)

                 I read the article in Forbes.                          



        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi, we could discuss

                 industrialization of men's fashions

                 all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                 Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                 Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

                 actually...



        JUMP CUT:



        A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                         



        NAKATOMI CORPORATION.

        BOARD WORKSTATION.

        sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't have that code...!

                 (beat; to Hans)

                 You broke in here to access out

                 computer?!?  Any information you

                 could get -- they wake up in Tokyo

                 in the morning, they'll change it!

                 You won't be able to blackmail our

                 executives or threaten --



        Hans barks him to silence:



                                 HANS

                 SIT DOWN!



        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your

                 computer.

                 (beat)

                 I'm interested in the 640 million dollars

                 in negotiable bearer bonds you have in

                 you vault.



        ON Takagi's reaction.



                                 HANS

                 Yes...I know about them.  The code

                 key is a necessary step in accessing

                 the vault.



                                 TAKAGI

                 You want...money?  What kind of

                 terrorists are you?



                                 HANS

                 (amused)

                 Who said we were terrorists?



        MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                        



        He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of

        voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.



        CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                             



        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                 (weighing the gun)

                 The code key, please...?



                                 TAKAGI

                 It's useless to you!  There's seven

                 safeguards on our vault, and the

                 code key is only one of them!  You'll

                 never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.



                                 HANS

                 Then there's no reason not to tell

                 it to us.



                                 THEO

                 (aside to Karl)

                 I told you...



                                 KARL

                 It's not over...



        Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,

        turns back to Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 This is too nice a suit to ruin,

                 Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count

                 to three.  There will not be a

                 four.  Give me the code.



        He cocks the gun:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn

                 jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!

                 I'm telling you!  You're just going

                 to have to kill me --



                                 HANS

                 Okay.



        BANG!!  He pulls the trigger:



        OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                          



        reacts as if shot.



        HIS P.O.V.                                          



        The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and

        dripping...



        INSIDE                                               



        Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back,

        blood flowing out into the carpet.



        Hans springs to his feet:



                                 HANS

                 We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if

                 you can dispose of that. (the body)

                 Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's

                 work up on the machine floor.



        Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.



        OUTSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun

        bumps the underside of the table:



        INSIDE - HANS                                        



        hears it.  Karl is the first to move:



        KARL                                                 



        springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two

        adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is

        locked.



        KARL                                                 



        returns to Hans.



                                 KARL

                 Nothing...



                                 HANS

                 (nods)

                 See to Heinrich...

                 (to Theo)

                 Now...you can break the code key...?

                 You didn't bring me along for my

                 charming personality.



        As he heads for the elevator.



                                 THEO

                 (under his breath)

                 'Though you could have...



        Hans smiles, confident in his team, and follows.  CAMERA

        SETTLES ON the door that Karl found locked.



        INSIDE THE SUPPLY CLOSET - MCCLANE                   



        slowly lets out a breath, praying softly:

                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.

        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================100====================
        INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME    



        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                 ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                 HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                 ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                 MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                 (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                 ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



        HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)         



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        window on a loop back towards the roof.



        IN THE CHOPPER                                       



        Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Bank and we'll nail him!



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans whirls towards Kristoff.



                                 HANS

                 Blow the roof.  Now!



                                 KRISTOFF

                 But Karl and Uli are up there --



        CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans

        goes to it.



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane DIVES away from another burst.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You assholes, I'm on your side -- !



        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.



        LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                 



        The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,

        but they're okay.



        JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                        



        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



        THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                         



        Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation

        PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:



        MCCLANE                                              



        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



        INSIDE THE BUILDING                                  



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



        UP ON THE ROOF                                       



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!



        INSIDE                                               



        McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!



        THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                             



        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



        MCCLANE                                              



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:



        THE ROOF                                             



        to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        They scream, cry out:



        IN THE VAULT ROOM                                    



        As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work

        like automatons, piling up the bonds.



        MCCLANE                                              



        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:



        THE SHAFT                                            



        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like

        schrapnel:



        THE ELEVATOR                                         



        reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:



        WIDE SHOT                                            



        the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in

        on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:



        THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                              



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================116====================
        EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                            



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



        HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                   



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



        VERY CLOSE                                           



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



        WIDER                                                



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.



        DISSOLVE TO:



========================================
====================117====================
        EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                 



        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.



        CLOSER                                               



        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (calling out)

                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?



        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet

        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But

        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other

        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,

        is the truth.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (emotional)

                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I

                 couldn't have made it without you.



                                 POWELL

                 Bullshit.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...

                 Holly Gennero.



                                 HOLLY

                 (taking Powell's hand,

                 correcting)

                 Holly McClane.



        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                  



                                 POWELL

                 (to her)

                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't

                 need me to give you that message

                 anymore.



                                 HOLLY

                 (puzzled)

                 Message?



        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's

        direction.



                                 POWELL

                 You know, about him being such a

                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --

                 (seeing McClane)

                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill

                 you in.



        Just then Robinson barges forward.



                                 ROBINSON

                 I want you for debrief, McClane.

                 You've got some things to answer

                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property

                 damage -- interfering with police                     

                 business --



        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.

                 (to the officer)

                 I thought you had him.



                                 OFFICER

                 I did.  He said something about a,

                 a double cross...

        Karl hovers over McClane, who hasn't moved a muscle.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 We're both professionals.  But this

                 is personal.  You...are done.



        WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.  McClane follows his first

        blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning karate

        kick SLAMS McClane back.

        Eddie turns from a window, where the chopper lights loom closer.



                                 EDDIE

                 They're coming.



        CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where

        Hans nods, stands.



                                 THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV

                 -- I know you're proud of your daddy...



        CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                      



        She's speechless, watching in shock as:



        THE PORTABLE TV                                      



        shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.



                                 THORNBURG

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 And your mom has shown just as much

                 courage.  But is there something you

                 would like to say to them if they're

                 watching?



        John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.



                                 LUCY

                 Come home.



        HOLLY                                                



        She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her

        head, looks at Hans.



        HER P.O.V. - HANS                                    



        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.



                                 HANS

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!



                                 HANS

                 (shouting)

                 On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs,

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.

        McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                 scream when I broke his fucking

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.

        THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson

        and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks

        aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his

        sniper scoped assault rifle.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (shouting, to the pilot)

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.

        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.

        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.

        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.

        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.

        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.

        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:

        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:

        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================11====================
        INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                            



        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (surprised, actually feeling

                 tension decline)

                 Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



        Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

        shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                 What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's a long story.  You know, I

                 think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                 That's okay...

                 (pause)

                 ... I have an eye on his private

                 bathroom.



        McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

        to show any).

                                                                       



                                 HOLLY

                 So, where are you staying?  This                     

                 all happened so fast I didn't even

                 ask you on the phone.



        McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                 here a couple years ago.  He said I

                 could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                 Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                 Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                 whole time...Look, let's make this

                 easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                 not huge, but the kids would love to

                 have you at the house.



        McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                 They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                 (beat; honest)

                 I would too.

                                                                       

        They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

        says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



        Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

        door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

        retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

        tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                 ...I've missed you.                                  



                                 MCCLANE

                 Especially my name.  You must miss

                 it every time you write a check.  When

                 did you start calling yourself

                 'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                 (caught)

                 This is a Japanese company, you know?

                 They figure a married woman, she's on

                 the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                 this one particular married woman,

                 she went out the door so fast there

                 was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                 talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                 Didn't we have this same conversation

                 in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                 an opportunity out here -- I had to

                 take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                 My job and my title and my salary did

                 nothing to our marriage except change

                 your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                 'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                 I never should've let you get those

                 magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                 You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                 It's a partnership where people help

                 each other over the rough spots --

                 console each other when there's a

                 down...and when there's an up, well,

                 hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                 an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                 (quietly)

                 I needed that, John.

                 (pause)

                 I deserved that.



        There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

        say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                 Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                 for you...he wants you to say something

                 to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                 Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                 Oh, this is --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (mock bright 'radio' voice)

                 Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

                 sensitive and supportive man of the

                 eighties.



        Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

        door.



                                 HOLLY

                 I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't I always?



        She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to himself)

                 Schmuck!



========================================
====================12====================
        INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME                       



        The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his

        monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the

        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.  As

        they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear

        their conversation.



                                 MAN #1 (THEO)

                 (animatedly)

                 ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,

                 this is a great play -- feeds Worthy

                 on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,

                 back to Worthy in the lane and --



        Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a

        silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the

        Guard can react he pulls the trigger.



                                 THEO

                 (dryly)

                 Boom...two points.



        (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone

        for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the

        desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.



        His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock

        drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video

        monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his

        briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.



                                 THEO

                 We're in.



        ON THE SCREEN                                         



        the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of

        the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the

        service elevator.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================28====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                         



        Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone

        seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of

        Wagner.



                                 HANS

                 Nice suit.  John Philips...London?



        Takagi stares at him, speechless.



                                 HANS

                 (smiles)

                 I have two myself.

                 (beat, as he exits:)

                 I'm told Arafat shops there too...



========================================
====================30====================
        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT       



        Hands enters, looks around.                                      



                                 HANS                                    

                 And when Alexander saw the breadth

                 of his domain, he wept.  For there

                 were no more worlds to conquer.

                 (to Takagi)

                 The benefits of a classical education.



        Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are          

        photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

        Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.



                                 HANS

                 It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed

                 models as a boy.  The exactness, the

                 attention to every foreseeable detail...

                 perfection.



                                 TAKAGI

                 (defensively)

                 This is what this is about?  Out

                 building project in Indonesia?

                 Contrary to what you people think,

                 we're going to develop that region...

                 not 'exploit' it.



        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 I believe you.

                 (smiling)

                 I read the article in Forbes.                          



        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi, we could discuss

                 industrialization of men's fashions

                 all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                 Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                 Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

                 actually...



        JUMP CUT:



        A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                         



        NAKATOMI CORPORATION.

        BOARD WORKSTATION.

        ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _.



        THEO                                                 



        sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't have that code...!

                 (beat; to Hans)

                 You broke in here to access out

                 computer?!?  Any information you

                 could get -- they wake up in Tokyo

                 in the morning, they'll change it!

                 You won't be able to blackmail our

                 executives or threaten --



        Hans barks him to silence:



                                 HANS

                 SIT DOWN!



        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your

                 computer.

                 (beat)

                 I'm interested in the 640 million dollars

                 in negotiable bearer bonds you have in

                 you vault.



        ON Takagi's reaction.



                                 HANS

                 Yes...I know about them.  The code

                 key is a necessary step in accessing

                 the vault.



                                 TAKAGI

                 You want...money?  What kind of

                 terrorists are you?



                                 HANS

                 (amused)

                 Who said we were terrorists?



        MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                        



        He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of

        voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.



        CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                             



        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                 (weighing the gun)

                 The code key, please...?



                                 TAKAGI

                 It's useless to you!  There's seven

                 safeguards on our vault, and the

                 code key is only one of them!  You'll

                 never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.



                                 HANS

                 Then there's no reason not to tell

                 it to us.



                                 THEO

                 (aside to Karl)

                 I told you...



                                 KARL

                 It's not over...



        Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,

        turns back to Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 This is too nice a suit to ruin,

                 Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count

                 to three.  There will not be a

                 four.  Give me the code.



        He cocks the gun:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn

                 jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!

                 I'm telling you!  You're just going

                 to have to kill me --



                                 HANS

                 Okay.



        BANG!!  He pulls the trigger:



        OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                          



        reacts as if shot.



        HIS P.O.V.                                          



        The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and

        dripping...



        INSIDE                                               



        Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back,

        blood flowing out into the carpet.



        Hans springs to his feet:



                                 HANS

                 We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if

                 you can dispose of that. (the body)

                 Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's

                 work up on the machine floor.



        Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.



        OUTSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun

        bumps the underside of the table:



        INSIDE - HANS                                        



        hears it.  Karl is the first to move:



        KARL                                                 



        springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two

        adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is

        locked.



        KARL                                                 



        returns to Hans.



                                 KARL

                 Nothing...



                                 HANS

                 (nods)

                 See to Heinrich...

                 (to Theo)

                 Now...you can break the code key...?



                                 THEO

                 (grins)

                 You didn't bring me along for my

                 charming personality.



        As he heads for the elevator.



                                 THEO

                 (under his breath)

                 'Though you could have...



        Hans smiles, confident in his team, and follows.  CAMERA

        SETTLES ON the door that Karl found locked.



        INSIDE THE SUPPLY CLOSET - MCCLANE                   



        slowly lets out a breath, praying softly:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Tell me you heard the shot.

                 Tell me you heard the shot and you're

                 calling the police right now...



        CUT TO:

====================99====================
        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================

        INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME    



        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                 ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                 HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                 ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                 MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                 (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                 ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.



        CUT TO:

                                 HANS

                 (supervising the work)

                 Schnell, schnell...der zeitz ist kurz...



        Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:



        VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                    



        Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages

        coming back into the room!



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



        HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)         



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        window on a loop back towards the roof.



        IN THE CHOPPER                                       



        Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Bank and we'll nail him!



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans whirls towards Kristoff.



                                 HANS

                 Blow the roof.  Now!



                                 KRISTOFF

                 But Karl and Uli are up there --



        CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans

        goes to it.



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane DIVES away from another burst.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You assholes, I'm on your side -- !



        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.



        LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                 



        The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,

        but they're okay.



        JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                        



        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



        THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                         



        Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation

        PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:



        MCCLANE                                              



        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



        INSIDE THE BUILDING                                  



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



        UP ON THE ROOF                                       



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!



        INSIDE                                               



        McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!



        THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                             



        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



        MCCLANE                                              



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:



        THE ROOF                                             



        to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        They scream, cry out:



        IN THE VAULT ROOM                                    



        As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work

        like automatons, piling up the bonds.



        MCCLANE                                              



        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:



        THE SHAFT                                            



        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like

        schrapnel:



        THE ELEVATOR                                         



        reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:



        WIDE SHOT                                            



        the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in

        on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:



        THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                              



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!



        CUT TO:

====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================116====================
        EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                            



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



        HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                   



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



        VERY CLOSE                                           



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



        WIDER                                                



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.



        DISSOLVE TO:



========================================
====================117====================
        EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                 



        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.



        CLOSER                                               



        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (calling out)

                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?



        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet

        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But

        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other

        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,

        is the truth.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (emotional)

                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I

                 couldn't have made it without you.



                                 POWELL

                 Bullshit.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...

                 Holly Gennero.



                                 HOLLY

                 (taking Powell's hand,

                 correcting)

                 Holly McClane.



        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                  



                                 POWELL

                 (to her)

                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't

                 need me to give you that message

                 anymore.



                                 HOLLY

                 (puzzled)

                 Message?



        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's

        direction.



                                 POWELL

                 You know, about him being such a

                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --

                 (seeing McClane)

                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill

                 you in.



        Just then Robinson barges forward.



                                 ROBINSON

                 I want you for debrief, McClane.

                 You've got some things to answer

                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property

                 damage -- interfering with police                     

                 business --



        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 watching?



        John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.



                                 LUCY

                 Come home.



        HOLLY                                                



        She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her

        head, looks at Hans.



        HER P.O.V. - HANS                                    



        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.



                                 HANS

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!



                                 HANS

                 (shouting)

                 On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs,

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.

        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.

        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.



        CUT TO:



        VAULT FLOOR                                          



        Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.



                                 HANS

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

                 McClane!  McClane!  I have some news

                 for you...McClane?



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 McClane?

                 (pause, then on a

                 new channel)

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.



                                 HANS

                 Hurry.



        THE ROOF                                             



        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON                                  



        Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.



        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================11====================
        INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                            



        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (surprised, actually feeling

                 tension decline)

                 Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



        Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

        shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                 What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's a long story.  You know, I

                 think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                 That's okay...

                 (pause)

                 ... I have an eye on his private

                 bathroom.



        McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

        to show any).

                                                                       



                                 HOLLY

                 So, where are you staying?  This                     

                 all happened so fast I didn't even

                 ask you on the phone.



        McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                 here a couple years ago.  He said I

                 could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                 Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                 Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                 whole time...Look, let's make this

                 easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                 not huge, but the kids would love to

                 have you at the house.



        McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                 They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                 (beat; honest)

                 I would too.

                                                                       

        They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

        says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



        Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

        door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

        retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

        tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                 ...I've missed you.                                  



                                 MCCLANE

                 Especially my name.  You must miss

                 it every time you write a check.  When

                 did you start calling yourself

                 'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                 (caught)

                 This is a Japanese company, you know?

                 They figure a married woman, she's on

                 the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                 this one particular married woman,

                 she went out the door so fast there

                 was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                 talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                 Didn't we have this same conversation

                 in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                 an opportunity out here -- I had to

                 take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                 My job and my title and my salary did

                 nothing to our marriage except change

                 your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                 'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                 I never should've let you get those

                 magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                 You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                 It's a partnership where people help

                 each other over the rough spots --

                 console each other when there's a

                 down...and when there's an up, well,

                 hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                 an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                 (quietly)

                 I needed that, John.

                 (pause)

                 I deserved that.



        There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

        say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                 Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                 for you...he wants you to say something

                 to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                 Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                 Oh, this is --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (mock bright 'radio' voice)

                 Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

                 sensitive and supportive man of the

                 eighties.



        Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

        door.



                                 HOLLY

                 I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't I always?



        She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to himself)

                 Schmuck!



========================================
====================12====================
        INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME                       



        The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his

        monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the

        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.  As

        they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear

        their conversation.



                                 MAN #1 (THEO)

                 (animatedly)

                 ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,

                 this is a great play -- feeds Worthy

                 on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,

                 back to Worthy in the lane and --



        Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a

        silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the

        Guard can react he pulls the trigger.



                                 THEO

                 (dryly)

                 Boom...two points.



        (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone

        for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the

        desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.



        His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock

        drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video

        monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his

        briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.



                                 THEO

                 We're in.



        ON THE SCREEN                                         



        the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of

        the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the

        service elevator.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================28====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                         



        Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone

        seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of

        Wagner.



                                 HANS

                 Nice suit.  John Philips...London?



        Takagi stares at him, speechless.



                                 HANS

                 (smiles)

                 I have two myself.

                 (beat, as he exits:)

                 I'm told Arafat shops there too...



========================================
====================30====================
        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT       



        Hands enters, looks around.                                      



                                 HANS                                    

                 And when Alexander saw the breadth

                 of his domain, he wept.  For there

                 were no more worlds to conquer.

                 (to Takagi)

                 The benefits of a classical education.



        Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are          

        photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

        Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.



                                 HANS

                 It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed

                 models as a boy.  The exactness, the

                 attention to every foreseeable detail...

                 perfection.



                                 TAKAGI

                 (defensively)

                 This is what this is about?  Out

                 building project in Indonesia?

                 Contrary to what you people think,

                 we're going to develop that region...

                 not 'exploit' it.



        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 I believe you.

                 (smiling)

                 I read the article in Forbes.                          



        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi, we could discuss

                 industrialization of men's fashions

                 all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                 Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                 Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

                 actually...



        JUMP CUT:



        A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                         



        NAKATOMI CORPORATION.

        BOARD WORKSTATION.

        ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _.



        THEO                                                 



        sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't have that code...!

                 (beat; to Hans)

                 You broke in here to access out

                 computer?!?  Any information you

                 could get -- they wake up in Tokyo

                 in the morning, they'll change it!

                 You won't be able to blackmail our

                 executives or threaten --



        Hans barks him to silence:



                                 HANS

                 SIT DOWN!



        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your

                 computer.

                 (beat)

                 I'm interested in the 640 million dollars

                 in negotiable bearer bonds you have in

                 you vault.



        ON Takagi's reaction.



                                 HANS

                 Yes...I know about them.  The code

                 key is a necessary step in accessing

                 the vault.



                                 TAKAGI

                 You want...money?  What kind of

                 terrorists are you?



                                 HANS

                 (amused)

                 Who said we were terrorists?



        MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                        



        He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of

        voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.



        CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                             



        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                 (weighing the gun)

                 The code key, please...?



                                 TAKAGI

                 It's useless to you!  There's seven

                 safeguards on our vault, and the

                 code key is only one of them!  You'll

                 never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.



                                 HANS

                 Then there's no reason not to tell

                 it to us.



                                 THEO

                 (aside to Karl)

                 I told you...



                                 KARL

                 It's not over...



        Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,

        turns back to Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 This is too nice a suit to ruin,

                 Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count

                 to three.  There will not be a

                 four.  Give me the code.



        He cocks the gun:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn

                 jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!

                 I'm telling you!  You're just going

                 to have to kill me --



                                 HANS

                 Okay.



        BANG!!  He pulls the trigger:



        OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                          



        reacts as if shot.



        HIS P.O.V.                                          



        The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and

        dripping...



        INSIDE                                               



        Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back,

        blood flowing out into the carpet.



        Hans springs to his feet:



                                 HANS

                 We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if

                 you can dispose of that. (the body)

                 Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's

                 work up on the machine floor.



        Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.



        OUTSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun

        bumps the underside of the table:



        INSIDE - HANS                                        



        hears it.  Karl is the first to move:



        KARL                                                 



        springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two

        adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is

        locked.



        KARL                                                 



        returns to Hans.



                                 KARL

                 Nothing...



                                 HANS

                 (nods)

                 See to Heinrich...

                 (to Theo)

                 Now...you can break the code key...?



                                 THEO

                 (grins)

                 You didn't bring me along for my

                 charming personality.



        As he heads for the elevator.



                                 THEO

                 (under his breath)

                 'Though you could have...



        Hans smiles, confident in his team, and follows.  CAMERA

        SETTLES ON the door that Karl found locked.



        INSIDE THE SUPPLY CLOSET - MCCLANE                   



        slowly lets out a breath, praying softly:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Tell me you heard the shot.

                 Tell me you heard the shot and you're

                 calling the police right now...

        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.

                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.

        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================100====================
        INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME    



        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                 ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                 HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                 ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                 MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                 (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                 ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.



        CUT TO:

====================114====================
        INT. VAULT ROOM                                      



                                 HANS

                 (supervising the work)

                 Schnell, schnell...der zeitz ist kurz...



        Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:



        VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                    



        Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages

        coming back into the room!



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



        HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)         



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        window on a loop back towards the roof.



        IN THE CHOPPER                                       



        Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Bank and we'll nail him!



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans whirls towards Kristoff.



                                 HANS

                 Blow the roof.  Now!



                                 KRISTOFF

                 But Karl and Uli are up there --



        CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans

        goes to it.



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane DIVES away from another burst.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You assholes, I'm on your side -- !



        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.



        LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                 



        The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,

        but they're okay.



        JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                        



        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



        THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                         



        Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation

        PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:



        MCCLANE                                              



        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



        INSIDE THE BUILDING                                  



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



        UP ON THE ROOF                                       



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!



        INSIDE                                               



        McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!



        THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                             



        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



        MCCLANE                                              



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:



        THE ROOF                                             



        to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        They scream, cry out:



        IN THE VAULT ROOM                                    



        As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work

        like automatons, piling up the bonds.



        MCCLANE                                              



        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:



        THE SHAFT                                            



        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like

        schrapnel:



        THE ELEVATOR                                         



        reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:



        WIDE SHOT                                            



        the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in

        on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:



        THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                              



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================116====================
        EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                            



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



        HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                   



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



        VERY CLOSE                                           



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



        WIDER                                                



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.



        DISSOLVE TO:



========================================
====================117====================
        EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                 



        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.



        CLOSER                                               



        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (calling out)

                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?



        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet

        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But

        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other

        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,

        is the truth.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (emotional)

                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I

                 couldn't have made it without you.



                                 POWELL

                 Bullshit.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...

                 Holly Gennero.



                                 HOLLY

                 (taking Powell's hand,

                 correcting)

                 Holly McClane.



        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                  



                                 POWELL

                 (to her)

                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't

                 need me to give you that message

                 anymore.



                                 HOLLY

                 (puzzled)

                 Message?



        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's

        direction.



                                 POWELL

                 You know, about him being such a

                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --

                 (seeing McClane)

                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill

                 you in.



        Just then Robinson barges forward.



                                 ROBINSON

                 I want you for debrief, McClane.

                 You've got some things to answer

                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property

                 damage -- interfering with police                     

                 business --



        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.



========================================
====================99====================
        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.

        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?

        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.

                 (quietly)

                 We're both professionals.  But this

                 is personal.  You...are done.



        WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.

        CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where

        Hans nods, stands.

        shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.



                                 THORNBURG

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 And your mom has shown just as much

                 courage.  But is there something you

        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

                 (shouting, to the pilot)

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================11====================
        INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                            



        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (surprised, actually feeling

                 tension decline)

                 Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



        Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

        shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                 What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's a long story.  You know, I

                 think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                 That's okay...

                 (pause)

                 ... I have an eye on his private

                 bathroom.



        McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

        to show any).

                                                                       



                                 HOLLY

                 So, where are you staying?  This                     

                 all happened so fast I didn't even

                 ask you on the phone.



        McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                 here a couple years ago.  He said I

                 could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                 Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                 Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                 whole time...Look, let's make this

                 easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                 not huge, but the kids would love to

                 have you at the house.



        McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                 They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                 (beat; honest)

                 I would too.

                                                                       

        They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

        says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



        Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

        door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

        retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

        tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                 ...I've missed you.                                  



                                 MCCLANE

                 Especially my name.  You must miss

                 it every time you write a check.  When

                 did you start calling yourself

                 'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                 (caught)

                 This is a Japanese company, you know?

                 They figure a married woman, she's on

                 the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                 this one particular married woman,

                 she went out the door so fast there

                 was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                 talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                 Didn't we have this same conversation

                 in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                 an opportunity out here -- I had to

                 take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                 My job and my title and my salary did

                 nothing to our marriage except change

                 your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                 'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                 I never should've let you get those

                 magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                 You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                 It's a partnership where people help

                 each other over the rough spots --

                 console each other when there's a

                 down...and when there's an up, well,

                 hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                 an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                 (quietly)

                 I needed that, John.

                 (pause)

                 I deserved that.



        There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

        say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                 Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                 for you...he wants you to say something

                 to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                 Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                 Oh, this is --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (mock bright 'radio' voice)

                 Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

                 sensitive and supportive man of the

                 eighties.



        Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

        door.



                                 HOLLY

                 I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't I always?



        She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to himself)

                 Schmuck!

        The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his

        monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the

        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.  As

        they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear

        their conversation.



                                 MAN #1 (THEO)

                 (animatedly)

                 ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,

                 this is a great play -- feeds Worthy

                 on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,

                 back to Worthy in the lane and --



        Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a

        silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the

        Guard can react he pulls the trigger.



                                 THEO

                 (dryly)

                 Boom...two points.



        (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone

        for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the

        desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.



        His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock

        drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video

        monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his

        briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.



                                 THEO

                 We're in.



        ON THE SCREEN                                         



        the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of

        the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the

        service elevator.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                         



        Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone

        seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of

        Wagner.



                                 HANS

                 Nice suit.  John Philips...London?



        Takagi stares at him, speechless.



                                 HANS

                 (smiles)

                 I have two myself.

                 (beat, as he exits:)

                 I'm told Arafat shops there too...



========================================
====================30====================
        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT       



        Hands enters, looks around.                                      



                                 HANS                                    

                 And when Alexander saw the breadth

                 of his domain, he wept.  For there

                 were no more worlds to conquer.

                 (to Takagi)

                 The benefits of a classical education.



        Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are          

        photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

        Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.



                                 HANS

                 It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed

                 models as a boy.  The exactness, the

                 attention to every foreseeable detail...

                 perfection.



                                 TAKAGI

                 (defensively)

                 This is what this is about?  Out

                 building project in Indonesia?

                 Contrary to what you people think,

                 we're going to develop that region...

                 not 'exploit' it.



        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 I believe you.

                 (smiling)

                 I read the article in Forbes.                          



        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi, we could discuss

                 industrialization of men's fashions

                 all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                 Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                 Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

                 actually...



        JUMP CUT:



        A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                         



        NAKATOMI CORPORATION.

        BOARD WORKSTATION.

        ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _.



        THEO                                                 



        sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't have that code...!

                 (beat; to Hans)

                 You broke in here to access out

                 computer?!?  Any information you

                 could get -- they wake up in Tokyo

                 in the morning, they'll change it!

                 You won't be able to blackmail our

                 executives or threaten --



        Hans barks him to silence:



                                 HANS

                 SIT DOWN!



        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your

                 computer.

                 (beat)

                 I'm interested in the 640 million dollars

                 in negotiable bearer bonds you have in

                 you vault.



        ON Takagi's reaction.



                                 HANS

                 Yes...I know about them.  The code

                 key is a necessary step in accessing

                 the vault.



                                 TAKAGI

                 You want...money?  What kind of

                 terrorists are you?



                                 HANS

                 (amused)

                 Who said we were terrorists?



        MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                        



        He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of

        voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.



        CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                             



        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                 (weighing the gun)

                 The code key, please...?



                                 TAKAGI

                 It's useless to you!  There's seven

                 safeguards on our vault, and the

                 code key is only one of them!  You'll

                 never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.



                                 HANS

                 Then there's no reason not to tell

                 it to us.



                                 THEO

                 (aside to Karl)

                 I told you...



                                 KARL

                 It's not over...



        Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,

        turns back to Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 This is too nice a suit to ruin,

                 Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count

                 to three.  There will not be a

                 four.  Give me the code.



        He cocks the gun:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn

                 jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!

                 I'm telling you!  You're just going

                 to have to kill me --



                                 HANS

                 Okay.



        BANG!!  He pulls the trigger:



        OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                          



        reacts as if shot.



        HIS P.O.V.                                          



        The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and

        dripping...



        INSIDE                                               



        Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back,

        blood flowing out into the carpet.



        Hans springs to his feet:



                                 HANS

                 We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if

                 you can dispose of that. (the body)

                 Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's

                 work up on the machine floor.



        Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.



        OUTSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun

        bumps the underside of the table:



        INSIDE - HANS                                        



        hears it.  Karl is the first to move:



        KARL                                                 



        springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two

        adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is

        locked.



        KARL                                                 



        returns to Hans.



                                 KARL

                 Nothing...



                                 HANS

                 (nods)

                 See to Heinrich...

                 (to Theo)

                 Now...you can break the code key...?



                                 THEO

                 (grins)

                 You didn't bring me along for my

                 charming personality.



        As he heads for the elevator.



                                 THEO

                 (under his breath)

                 'Though you could have...



        Hans smiles, confident in his team, and follows.  CAMERA

        SETTLES ON the door that Karl found locked.



        INSIDE THE SUPPLY CLOSET - MCCLANE                   



        slowly lets out a breath, praying softly:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Tell me you heard the shot.

                 Tell me you heard the shot and you're

                 calling the police right now...



        CUT TO:

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?

        TV - CLOSE

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================

        INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME    



        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                 ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                 HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                 ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                 MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                 (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                 ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.



        CUT TO:

        Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:



        VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                    



        Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages

        coming back into the room!



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



        HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)         



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        window on a loop back towards the roof.



        IN THE CHOPPER                                       



        Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY

        Hans whirls towards Kristoff.



                                 HANS

                 Blow the roof.  Now!



                                 KRISTOFF

                 But Karl and Uli are up there --



        CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans

        goes to it.



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane DIVES away from another burst.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You assholes, I'm on your side -- !



        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.



        LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                 



        The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,

        but they're okay.



        JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                        



        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



        THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                         



        Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation

        PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:



        MCCLANE                                              



        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



        INSIDE THE BUILDING                                  



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



        UP ON THE ROOF                                       



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!



        INSIDE                                               



        McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!



        THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                             



        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



        MCCLANE                                              



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:



        THE ROOF                                             



        to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        They scream, cry out:



        IN THE VAULT ROOM                                    



        As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work

        like automatons, piling up the bonds.



        MCCLANE                                              



        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:



        THE SHAFT                                            



        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like

        schrapnel:



        THE ELEVATOR                                         



        reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:



        WIDE SHOT                                            



        the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in

        on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:



        THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                              



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================116====================
        EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                            



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



        HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                   



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



        VERY CLOSE                                           



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



        WIDER                                                



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.



        DISSOLVE TO:



========================================
====================117====================
        EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                 



        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.



        CLOSER                                               



        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (calling out)

                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?



        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet

        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But

        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other

        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,

        is the truth.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (emotional)

                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I

                 couldn't have made it without you.



                                 POWELL

                 Bullshit.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...

                 Holly Gennero.



                                 HOLLY

                 (taking Powell's hand,

                 correcting)

                 Holly McClane.



        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                  



                                 POWELL

                 (to her)

                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't

                 need me to give you that message

                 anymore.



                                 HOLLY

                 (puzzled)

                 Message?



        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's

        direction.



                                 POWELL

                 You know, about him being such a

                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --

                 (seeing McClane)

                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill

                 you in.



        Just then Robinson barges forward.



                                 ROBINSON

                 I want you for debrief, McClane.

                 You've got some things to answer

                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property

                 damage -- interfering with police                     

                 business --



        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

                                 THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV

                 -- I know you're proud of your daddy...



        CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                      



        She's speechless, watching in shock as:



        THE PORTABLE TV                                      



        shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.



                                 THORNBURG

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 And your mom has shown just as much

                 courage.  But is there something you

                 would like to say to them if they're

                 watching?



        John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.



                                 LUCY

                 Come home.



        HOLLY                                                



        She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her

        head, looks at Hans.



        HER P.O.V. - HANS                                    



        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.



                                 HANS

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!



                                 HANS

                 (shouting)

                 On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs,

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.



        CUT TO:



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



                                 MCCLANE

                 You should've heard your brother

                 scream when I broke his fucking

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.



        CUT TO:



        INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT                    



        THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson

        and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks

        aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his

        sniper scoped assault rifle.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (shouting, to the pilot)

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.



        CUT TO:



        VAULT FLOOR                                          



        Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.



                                 HANS

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

                 McClane!  McClane!  I have some news

                 for you...McClane?



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 McClane?

                 (pause, then on a

                 new channel)

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.



                                 HANS

                 Hurry.



        THE ROOF                                             



        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON                                  



        Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.



        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.



========================================
====================99====================
        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

                 McClane!  McClane!  I have some news

                 for you...McClane?



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 McClane?

                 (pause, then on a

                 new channel)

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.



                                 HANS

                 Hurry.



        THE ROOF                                             



        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON                                  



        Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.



        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.

        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

        blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning karate

        kick SLAMS McClane back.

        CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where

        Hans nods, stands.

        shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.



                                 THORNBURG

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        up, each looking over the terrain.

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.



========================================
====================99====================
        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.



        CUT TO:



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



                                 MCCLANE

                 You should've heard your brother

                 scream when I broke his fucking

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.



        CUT TO:



        INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT                    



        THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson

        and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks

        aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his

        sniper scoped assault rifle.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (shouting, to the pilot)

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.



        CUT TO:



        VAULT FLOOR                                          



        Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.



                                 HANS

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

                 McClane!  McClane!  I have some news

                 for you...McClane?



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 new channel)

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.



                                 HANS

                 Hurry.



        THE ROOF                                             



        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON                                  



        Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.



        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.

        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:

        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.



========================================
====================99====================
        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 (to the children)

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                        



        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (pissed)

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.



        INTERCUT:



        ON POWELL                                           



        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (tired, touched)

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?

                 Pretty fucking unappreciated.

        Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.



                                 POWELL

                 Hey, I love you.

                 (looking around)

                 So do a lot of the guys.  So hang

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.

        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.



                                 GAIL

                 (as the picture

                 stabilizes)

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.



        CUT TO:

                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 We're both professionals.  But this

                 is personal.  You...are done.



        WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.  McClane follows his first

        blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning karate

        kick SLAMS McClane back.

        HOSTAGE FLOOR - NIGHT                                



        Eddie turns from a window, where the chopper lights loom closer.



                                 EDDIE

                 They're coming.



        CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where

        Hans nods, stands.



                                 THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV

                 -- I know you're proud of your daddy...



        CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                      



        She's speechless, watching in shock as:



        THE PORTABLE TV                                      



        shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his

        microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice

        is soft, comforting.



                                 THORNBURG

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 And your mom has shown just as much

                 courage.  But is there something you

                 would like to say to them if they're

                 watching?



        John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.



                                 LUCY

                 Come home.



        HOLLY                                                



        She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her

        head, looks at Hans.



        HER P.O.V. - HANS                                    



        He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on

        her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.



                                 HANS

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

        making everyone jump!



                                 HANS

                 (shouting)

                 On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs,

                 now!

                 (quietly, to Uli)

                 You'll lock them up there and come

                 right down...



        Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.

        Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.



        CUT TO:



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other

        up, each looking over the terrain.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



                                 MCCLANE

                 You should've heard your brother

                 scream when I broke his fucking

                 neck...



        Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,

        slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles

        McClane with new respect.



        CUT TO:



        INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT                    



        THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson

        and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks

        aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his

        sniper scoped assault rifle.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (shouting, to the pilot)

                 Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

                 not gunships.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.

        Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.



                                 HANS

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.

                 Hurry.

        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON

        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?

        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.

        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================3====================
        INT. LAX - EVENING                                    



        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest

        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,

        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an

        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE

        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she

        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear

        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (sotto, to himself)

                 California.



        He looks around the terminal at:



        HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                 



        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents

        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet

        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant

        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very

        touching and not the least bit corny.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the

        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an

        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a

        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written

        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm John McClane.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (introducing himself)

                 Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

                 nice bag.



        He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still juggling

        bag and giant animal.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?



                                 ARGYLE

                 (stops)

                 Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

                 help me, man.  This is my first time

                 driving a limo.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That's okay.  This is my first time

                 riding in one.



        CUT TO:



        WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                  



        TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.



        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.



                                 ARGYLE

                 Just kick back and relax, man.  We

                 got everything you need:  CD, CB,

                 TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.



        He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.



                                 ARGYLE

                 If your friend is hot to trot...I

                 know a couple of mama bears.

                 (turning to McClane)

                 ...Or is he married?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Married.



        McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE

        reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at

        Argyle.



                                 ARGYLE

                 The girl was off today.  Hey, I

                 didn't expect you to sit up front.

                 (back to the topic)

                 So, your lady live out here?



                                 MCCLANE

                 The past six months.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (thinking about that)

                 Meanwhile, you still live in

                 New York?



                                 MCCLANE

                 You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?



                                 ARGYLE

                 Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

                 cabdriver, see, people expected a little

                 chit chat, a little eccentricity and

                 comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

                 limo guys were, so excuse me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (amused)

                 It's okay, it's okay.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (instantly)

                 So, you divorced of what?



        McClane gives up.



                                 MCCLANE

                 She had a good job, it turned into

                 a great career.



                                 ARGYLE

                 But meant her moving here.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Closer to Japan.  You're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 So, why didn't you come?



                                 MCCLANE

                 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

                 to be a New York kid, and I got six

                 months backlog of New York scumbags

                 I'm still trying to put behind bars.

                 I don't just get up and move.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (to the point)

                 You mean you thought she wouldn't

                 make it out here and she'd come

                 crawling on back, so why bother to

                 pack?



        McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (popping in a cassette)

                 Mind if I play some tunes?



        A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.



                                 MCCLANE

                 How 'bout some Christmas music?



                                 ARGYLE

                 That is Christmas music.



        And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a

        revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane

        gives up, looks out the window.



        HIS P.O.V.                                            



        Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,

        Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees

        trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token

        "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has

        its own unique style.



        THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                              



        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,

        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls

        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,

        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to

        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.



========================================
====================34====================
        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME               



        He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.



                                 HANS

                 (calmly, to Eddie

                 on CB)

                 Call 911, give them the name and

                 badge number on your uniform and

                 cancel the alarm...then disable

                 the system.

                 (looks across at

                 Tony, presses talk

                 button again)

                 Eddie?  What floor did the alarm

                 go off?



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and          

        Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.



        UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                              



        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance

        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

        Avenue of the Stars.



        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the

        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and

        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (realizing)

                 Son of a bitch...



        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS

        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he

        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire

        floor.  McClane is gone.



        ON MCCLANE                                           



        under a desk.  He takes in his options.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane

        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series

        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path

        if he can make it past Tony.



        TONY                                                 



        He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.



                                 TONY

                 The fire has been called off, my

                 friend.  No one is coming to help

                 you.  You might as well come out

                 and join the others.

                 (fingers the trigger

                 of his machine gun)

                 I promise not to hurt you.



        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then

        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As

        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another

        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

        the cubicles.



        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past

        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches

        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the

        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.



        TONY'S P.O.V.                                        



        A radial arm saw spins noisily.



        TONY                                                 



        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not

        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,

        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel

        against Tony's temple.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Freeze, Police...don't move or name

                 your beneficiary.



        Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him

        calmly.



                                 TONY

                 You won't hurt me.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah?  Why not?



                                 TONY

                 (smug)

                 Because you are a policeman.  There

                 are rules for policemen.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling

                 me the same thing.



        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony

        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Let's go.



        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the

        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends

        his pistol into the hall.



        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.



        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that

        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they

        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen

        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash

        into:



        STAIRWELL LANDING                                    



        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.

        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto

        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly

        to the side.



        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,

        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets

        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very

        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on

        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND

        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.



        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during

        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.



        CUT TO:



========================================
====================35====================
        INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                              



        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the

        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's

        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take

        a couple of steps.



        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking

        the boots off.



                                 MCCLANE

                 A million terrorists in the world

                 and I kill the one with feet

                 smaller than my sister.



        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then

        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.

        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:



        A DESK                                               



        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles

        to himself.



        IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                   



        TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and

        30th floors.



        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden

        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.



        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's

        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with

        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.



        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the

        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and

        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof

        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting

        the car in motion again.



        HOSTAGE FLOOR                                        



        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center

        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are

        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny

        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.

        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern

        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.



                                 HANS

                 I wanted this to be professional,

                 efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not

                 a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi

                 did not see it that way...

                 (harder)

                 So he won't be joining us for the

                 rest of his life.

                 (as that sinks in)

                 We are prepared to go any way you

                 make us.  When we have achieved our

                 aims you can walk out of here...

                 or be carried out.  Decide now, each

                 of you.  But remember that we have

                 planned everything to the last detail.

                 We are completely in change.



        A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.



        NEW ANGLE                                            



        The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:



        TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.                             



        Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat

        gaily placed on his head.



        HANS                                                 



        REACTS.



                                 HANS

                 (indicating the hostages)

                 Get them over there.  Schnell!



        The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to

        the elevator, but for before.



        HOLLY                                                



        Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's abilities...

        not to mention his twisted sense of humor.



        NEAR THE ELEVATOR                                    



        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with

        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been

        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,

        takes it out.



        INSERT - THE NOTE                                    



        It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."



        BACK TO SCENE



                                 FRITZ

                 Perhaps a security guard we

                 overlooked...?



        Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.



                                 HANS

                 (thoughtfully)

                 Security guard?  They're usually

                 tired and burned out old policemen growing              

                 fat on a pension...This is...

                 something else.



        ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME                         



        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just

        below.



        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The

        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then

        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1

        in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on    

        roof (3)."



                                 FRITZ'S VOICE

                 (slightly spooked)

                 We have to do something, Hans.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (not pleased)

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother

                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.



        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.



                                 HANS

                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

                 upstairs and out of sight.  I don't

                 want the hostages to think too

                 much.



========================================
====================36====================
        INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME   



        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco

        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.

        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,

        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes

        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the

        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car

        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the

        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the

        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.



        MCCLANE                                              



        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking

        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane

        pushes it open and looks in.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        Total darkness.



        MCCLANE                                              



        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we

        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't

        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Jesus...



        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder

        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door

        McClane enters a darkened:



        PUMP ROOM                                            



        damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the

        door and looks out.



        MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                     



        The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport

        above him is higher.



        30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME   



        WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers

        SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's       

        barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole

        into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling

        hands on the man's shoulder.



                                 HANS

                 I know what you are feeling.  But

                 this is not productive --



                                 KARL

                 (pushing him away)

                 He was my only brother...my only

                 family!

                 (a flat statement)

                 I want blood for my blood.  We

                 search...now.



        He starts to move.  Hans stops him.



                                 HANS

                 (firmly)

                 No.  Heinrich's team must finish

                 planting the detonators...and Theo

                 needs time on the vault.  After the                   

                 police come they'll waste hours trying

                 to negotiate...that's when we search                  

                 for this man.  Until then...we do not

                 alter the plan.



                                 KARL

                 (quietly)

                 And if he alters it...?                               



        For once Hands doesn't have an answer.



        HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                         



        They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among

        their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.



                                 ELLIS

                 What's happening?



                                 HOLLY

                 They don't look happy...something's

                 gone wrong.



                                 ELLIS

                 The police...?



                                 HOLLY

                 (shaking her head)

                 John.



                                 ELLIS

                 John?  Christ, he could fuck this

                 whole thing up...what does he think

                 he's doing?



                                 HOLLY

                 How about his job?



                                 ELLIS

                 His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without

                 him, they might let us go...at least

                 we have a chance...



                                 HOLLY

                 (quietly)

                 Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

        still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:



                                 POWELL'S VOICE

                 Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?

                 in there, man.  Hang in there.

                 Thanks...partner.



        TV - CLOSE                                          



        As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.



                                 GAIL

                 (on TV)

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.



                                 HARVEY

                 (on TV)

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

        the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                 HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                 ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                 (to the approaching

                 Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                 HOLLY

                 (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                 (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



        THE OFFICE                                          



                                 KARL

                 (in mid-speech,

                 angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                 HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                 KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                 ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                 HANS

                 (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                 ELLIS

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                 HANS

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



        CUT TO:



        POWELL                                              



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                 POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



        INSIDE - MCCLANE                                    



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                 POWELL

                 (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?



        THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                              



        Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name.



                                 THORSON

                 (to Mary)

                 Get on the phone to our New York

                 affiliate...move, move!



        POWELL                                              



        reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too.



        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.



========================================
====================106====================
        INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                        



        Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see

        from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts

        to climb up, not enjoying it.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:



                                 ROBINSON

                 The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?



                                 YOUNG COP

                 Yessir.  Right over there.



        Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.



                                 POWELL

                 (dryly)

                 You want a breath mint?



        Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:



        A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                            



        Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson

        steps up, sees: 



        HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                              



        They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (showing badge)

                 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

                 This is Agent Johnson...no relation.



                                 ROBINSON

                 (stepping forward, plastic

                 smile)

                 Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge

                 here.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Not any more.



        As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:



        THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                  



        He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the

        floor.



        LOW ANGLE                                             



        He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.

        A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Lost?



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.



        The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-

        boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,

        looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:



                                 HANS

                 --ohGodplease -- don't kill me --

                 don't kill me -- you're one of them,

                 I know it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (thrown, unsure)

                 Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt

                 you.  Who are you?  What are you

                 looking for?



        Hans' eyes dart towards:



        THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                            



        Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 HANS

                 A way up to the roof...I thought I

                 could signal for help --



        He starts in that direction.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Forget it.  They got a guy up there.

                 You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                 Hey?  You hear me?



        Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you're an American?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (friendly, easing the

                 man's fears)

                 Only if New Jersey counts.



        It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.



        CUT TO:



        OUTSIDE BUILDING                                      



                                 ROBINSON

                 (in mid-speech to FBI)

                 We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five

                 hostages, probably on the 30th floor...

                 seven, maybe eight terrorists.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.



        Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Thank you.  We'll handle it from

                 here.  When we need to commandeer

                 your men, we'll try and let you know.



        He starts to move away with his partner.



                                 POWELL

                 (angry)

                 Aren't you forgetting something?



        Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Such as...?



                                 POWELL

                 (pointing to the building)

                 John McClane!  He's the man who gave

                 us all the information we've got!

                 He's the reason you're facing seven

                 terrorists instead of twelve.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 He's inside?  Who is he?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (nodding)

                 He may be a cop...we're checking

                 on that --



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 One of yours?



                                 ROBINSON

                 (too quickly)

                 No, sir.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 (after a moment)

                 If he's not a terrorist, and he's

                 not a hostage...he's just not part

                 of the equation.



        They start to walk away.



                                 POWELL

                 (indignant)

                 T...that's the same Goddamn thing

                 the terrorists said!



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (interested)

                 Really?

                 (to Big Johnson)

                 That's one good thing.  Sound like

                 we're dealing with pros.



        They leave.



        CUT TO:



        THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                    



        McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."



                                 HANS

                 (nodding)

                 There was a party -- celebration --

                 all of a sudden they were there --

                 shooting -- threatening us --



        CLOSER SHOT                                           



        McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to

        pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Relax, man...you smoke?



        Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers

        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to

        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and

        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.



                                 HANS

                 You...you don't work for Nakatomi...

                 and if you're not one of them...



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm a cop from New York.



                                 HANS

                 (puzzled)

                 New York...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (explaining)

                 They invited me to the Xmas party.

                 Who knew?



        Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Better than being caught with your

                 pants down, right?

                 (extending his hand)

                 John McClane.



                                 HANS

                 (shaking hands)

                 William Clay.

                 (smiling)

                 Call me Bill.



        McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over

        at:



        THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES             



        In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL,

        S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                         



                                 MCCLANE

                 Bill, you know how to use a handgun?



                                 HANS

                 (hesitant)

                 One weekend I went to a combat ranch...

                 (apologetic)

                 You know, that game with the, the guns

                 that shoot red paint?  Must sound

                 pretty silly to you...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sounds better than nothing.



        McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in

        a fresh one and hands it to him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Time for the real thing.



        McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a

        CLICK.  He slowly turns:



        NEW ANGLE                                             



        Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He

        holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into

        his radio in German.



                                 HANS

                 Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come

                 quickly.

                 (to McClane)

                 Put down your gun and give me my

                 detonators.



        McClane just looks at him.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans.  Your Hans.



                                 HANS

                 (nods, indicating McClane's

                 gun again)

                 Put it down now.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was tricky, with the accent.

                 I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.

                 Why do you need the detonators, Hans?

                 I already used the explosives.



                                 HANS

                 I'm going to count to three...



                                 MCCLANE

                 (cold)

                 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.



        McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE

        TRIGGER.



        Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in

        carefully, reclaims his pistol.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.



        Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.



                                 HANS

                 You were saying.



        McClane whirls in time to see:

                                                            

        KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ



        Coming out of it, FIRING.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take

        cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back

        at:



        WHERE HANS WAS                                      



        He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his

        passing.



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:



        BANK OF COMPUTERS                                   



        Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all

        around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:



        FRANCO                                              



        McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his

        weapon FLYING:



        CLOSER                                              



        He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.

        Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:



        MCCLANE                                             



        hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face

        suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

        He turns:



        HANS                                                



        has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.



        MCCLANE                                             



        FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his

        shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,

        who escapes with only superficial scratches.



        HANS                                                



        looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to

        Karl in German:



                                 HANS

                 The glass!  Shoot the glass!



        And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.



        MCCLANE                                             



        as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their

        BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big

        CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a

        million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end

        of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:



        HIS FOOT                                            



        goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:



        STAIRWELL DOOR                                      



        He's out, gone, safe!



        BACK TO SCENE                                       



        Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through

        rubble, then comes over, smiling.



        He's holding the bag of detonators.



                                 HANS

                 Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

        is soft, comforting.

                 (to the children)

                 ...because he's a very brave policeman.

                 Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

                 acquaintance.



        He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,

                 Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,

                 any faggot can shoot a gun.



        This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he

        does charge, it's unexpected.



        The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial

        training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.

                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (shouting over the noise

                 of the rotors)

                 What do you figure on breakage?



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 I figure we take out all the terrorists,

                 and lose 20 percent of the hostages...

                 25, tops.



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 I can live with those numbers.



        CUT TO:



        VAULT FLOOR                                          



        Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried

        all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they

        look curiously at Holly.



                                 HANS

                 A little bonus for us.

                 (shoving her forward

                 violently)

                 A policeman's wife might come in

                 handy.



        He picks up a CB, speaks into it.



                                 HANS

                 McClane!  McClane!  I have some news

                 for you...McClane?



        THE MACHINE FLOOR                                    



        TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.



        Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their

        tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 McClane?

                 (pause, then on a

                 new channel)

                 Karl?  Karl?



        Nothing.  He looks at Theo.



                                 HANS

                 Hurry.



        THE ROOF                                             



        Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few

        out.



        LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS    



        They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

        shaking the trees.



        POWELL AND ROBINSON                                  



        Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.



        HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                 



        They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly

        copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to

        himself, moves towards the door:



        VAULT ROOM                                           



        Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of

        the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.



                                 HOLLY

                 (to Hans, scornfully)

                 After all your posturing, all your

                 speeches...you're nothing but a common

                 thief.



                                 HANS

                 I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

                 And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,

                 you should be more polite.



        He SLAPS her.



        MACHINE FLOOR                                        



        Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.

        McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl

        charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs

        upwards, propelling Karl into the air:



        LOW ANGLE                                            



        Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes

        entangled.



        MCCLANE                                              



        jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.



        KARL                                                 



        is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured

        fish -- starts to turn blue:



        MCCLANE                                              



        Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane

        snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.



        CUT TO:



        CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                



        We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

        one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.



                                 BIG JOHNSON

                 Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?



                                 PILOT

                 My kind of town.



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,

        OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta

        in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped

        twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches

        up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges

        through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She

        meets him halfway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Where's Holly --



                                 GINNY

                 The took her -- after they saw the

                 kids on television --



                                 MCCLANE

                 What?  God --



        He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Listen to me!  All of you, get down

                 to the lower floors -- you're all

                 in danger.



                                 HOSTAGE

                 What are you, crazy?  We're being

                 rescued!  Those helicopters --



                                 MCCLANE

                 -- there won't be shit for those helicopters

                 to land on, because the whole top of this

                 building is wired with explosives!  Now

                 get below --



                                 SECOND HOSTAGE

                 But...we're safe up here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,

                 it's a launching pad!



        And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door

        as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.

        They really haul ass.



                                 MCCLANE

                 GET BELOW!  NOW!



        IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                        



        A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.



                                 YOUNG FBI

                 (into throat mike, looking

                 out the door)

                 Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think

                 they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

                 is firing on the hostages.



        INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                             



                                 LITTLE JOHNSON

                 (into mike)

                 Roger, Wing.  We copy.

                 (to the pilot)

                 Swing around.

                 (raising his rifle)

                 Give me a clear shot.



        The pilot nods.



========================================
====================115====================
        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!
