====================30====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING



    Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless

    walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's

    slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back

    faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes

    a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his

    breathing returns to normal.



    Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the

    dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep

    cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his

    briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches

    the blackboard.



    BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.

    First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

    Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins

    to write per the file folder in his hand...



    "GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S

    MARDSEN..."



    No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the

    class...



                                TREVOR

               ... Before taking roll, I'd like

               to prove a point.



    Now one or two students begin to notice the

    indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...













                                BARSEK

               (Armenian; a disparaging

               laugh)

               'Farfie?'

               (cholo-like)

               Whad up, Farfie?



    Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans

    and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk

    he is exorcising his demons...



                                TREVOR

               ... It's not important what... or

               who... 'Farfie' is.



    Turning to face the class now...



                                TREVOR

               Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay.

               Have a seat, please.



    A handful of students take their seats.



                                TREVOR

               (pacing now)

               The point I'd like to make is

               this... Anyone here can be a

               scientist.



    ... a grudging buzz of confusion.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (sotto; puzzled)

               ... What's he talking about?



                                TREVOR

               ... A scientist is like a

               detective. He investigates data.

               He scratches the surface of things

               he doesn't understand to see

               what's underneath.

               (pointing to blackboard)

               ... Things like this. Okay, who

               wants to read?



    Barsek (the class clown) breaks in...



                                BARSEK

               (standing up)

               I'll do it.



    Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down"

    and "Armenian Power sucks"...











                                TREVOR

               Come on, we don't need disrespect.

               Let 'im do it.

               (to Barsek)

               What's your name?



                                BARSEK

               Barsek.



    A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of

    Trevor's mouth.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, Barsek.     Read.



    (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied

    by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)



                                BARSEK

               ... Glis was very frapper. She

               had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen.

               She couldn't galp a giberter for

               Farfie. Instead she wharked to

               plimp a mardsen binky for him.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, anyone know what Barsek just

               said?



    ... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the

    end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.



                                TREVOR

               That's alright. You don't need to

               understand something to answer a

               few simple questions about it.

               Every one of you is capable of

               decoding data. Watch.



    Trevor writes question #1 on the board...



    1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?



                                TREVOR

               ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can

               anyone tell me?



    The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.



                                TREVOR

               (pointing at

               Asian Girl)

               Okay.











    Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences

    on the board.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (slowly; cautiously)

               ... Glis was frapper... because...

               she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen?



                                TREVOR

               (understated)

               That's right. You got it.

               (reactions all around)

               Let's try another.



    Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...



    2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?



                                TREVOR

               ... What did Glis plimp?



    Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an

    unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."

    Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.

    Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the

    sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.



                                TREVOR

               (searching blackboard

               ledge)

               ... Hold on, hold on. Where's

               your teacher keep the chalk?



                                ASIAN GIRL

               ... In the desk.



    Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A

    startling discovery abruptly halts his search...



    CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.

    Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.



    OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice

    interrupts...



                                CHILDRESS (O.S.)

               ... Can I help you?



    Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in

    the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk

    drawer. You can hear a pin drop.



    Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches

    Trevor.











                                CHILDRESS

               Sorry I'm late. Had to handle

               something. You a sub?



                                TREVOR

               (puzzled)

               I thought this was Science.

               Ms. Eskander.



    Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at

    Trevor's name on the board.



                                CHILDRESS

               No. This is Dave Childress,

               American History.



    Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... Don't know how to break it to

               you...

               (glancing at

               Trevor's name again)

               ... Garfield... but this is

               bungalow 84.



    Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's

    shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.



                                CHILDRESS

               See, you zigged when you shoulda

               zagged. Course it's not your

               fault someone jacked the number

               off my door. Keep askin' Garcia

               to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'



    Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing

    another bungalow across the way.



========================================
====================31====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE



    ... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway

    as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... that mess over there, that's

               Eskander's.



    OFF Trevor's unflinching stare...





========================================
====================39====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOSE ON VENETIAN BLINDS - LATER

    (AFTER SCHOOL)



    as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as

    suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the

    cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.



    A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to

    discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.



                                ELLEN

               May I come in?













                                TREVOR

               Yeah...

               (points at her)

               ... Ellen.



                                ELLENA

               (pointing back)

               Trevor.



    He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged

    over the clock.



                                TREVOR

               (explaining)

               I'm making time a reward instead

               of a distraction.



    Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.



                                ELLEN

               Clever... Listen, I wanted to

               apologize for jumping up like I

               did at lunch. I was just feeling

               a little weird...



                                TREVOR

               It's alright.



                                ELLEN

               For what it's worth, Dave

               Childress thinks you walk on

               water.



                                TREVOR

               Is that a good thing?



    Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.



                                ELLEN

               I think it takes a lot of

               courage to go back into a

               classroom after something like

               that.



                                TREVOR

               Not if the only thing you ever

               wanted to do was teach.



                                ELLEN

               (smiles)

               Now you see, there's our

               predicament.











    WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the

    window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

               I assume you've met Benny Chacon?



                                TREVOR

               I have.



                                ELLEN

               (absently)

               Last week Benny and his tagging

               crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in

               the corner over there.

               (pointing)

               ... She's seven months pregnant

               and he's tormenting her with a

               broom handle... Can I help you

               with those?



    Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

    but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.

    Ellen sees he's in pain.



                                TREVOR

               No thanks.



    She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.



                                ELLEN

               So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

               and if the district construes it

               as assault and battery on a

               student, she's gone.



                                TREVOR

               They'd do that?



                                ELLEN

               In a heart beat. She's non-

               tenured, they don't want to get

               sued...

               (with resignation)

               Don't be surprised if she files

               for stress leave by the end of

               the week. Too bad, too. She's a

               good teacher.



    WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.

    The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.



                                ELLEN

               Can I ask you a personal question?











    Trevor glances up.    Here's what she really wants to

    know...



                                ELLEN

               (tentatively now)

               Why'd that kid attack you?



                                TREVOR

               Because I flunked him.



                                ELLEN

               (sobered)

               Is there any way you can see

               something like that coming?



                                TREVOR

               When they say they wanna kill you,

               you'd best take it serious. This

               kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

               Transfer -- but nobody told me

               until it was too late.



    A beat.



                                ELLEN

               Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

               In less than a year he's been

               convicted of felony assault and

               suspended twice. I even testified

               against him as a character witness.

               Now I get to see him every day in

               homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

               Condition of his probation is

               that he stay in school.



                                TREVOR

               You talk to the principal?



                                ELLEN

               Many times... Three weeks ago,

               Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

               a conference, but she refuses to

               show up. She's afraid they'll

               deport her because she's illegal.

               So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

               some attorney tells her she

               doesn't have to come in.

               (still can't

               believe)

               Garcia got cold feet and dropped

               the whole thing.

               (fear building)

               This kid's threatening me and all

               he's worried about is a lawsuit.











                                TREVOR

               (intent now)

               What'd Benny say to you?



    Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for

    an awkward moment as she collects herself.



                                ELLEN

               That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

               bad.



                                TREVOR

               Does he know where you live?



                                ELLEN

               I think so. Someone's been phoning

               me at night and hanging up... Two

               weeks ago, my car was broken into...

               And last Friday, I think he was

               inside my house... But I can't

               prove it.



    The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the

    bungalow.



                                ELLEN

               (bottom lip quivers)

               ... I don't know what to do.



                                TREVOR

               You can quit.



                                ELLEN

               You didn't.



    OFF Trevor's severe gaze...



========================================
====================86====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - RAMBLER - CONTINUOUS

    ACTION



    Trevor and Ellen step out of the car.



                                TREVOR

               (tentatively)

               Jack?



    MOVING THROUGH the chain-link fence, into the front yard.

    Ellen whistles faintly. Trevor turns on his flashlight.



                                ELLEN

               Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to

               Mommy, sweetheart.



    The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the

    olive tree.



    Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.



                                ELLEN

               (reacting)

               ... Oh, my God.



    Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts

    pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as

    the flashlight traces the length of the chain...



                                ELLEN

               (right behind Trevor)

               Jack?!



    The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.

    Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.



========================================
====================87====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF ALLEY WALL - JACK



    centered in the flashlight beam, dangling there,

    strangled to death at the end of his dog collar.



========================================
====================88====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - ELLEN AND TREVOR - NIGHT



                                ELLEN

               (gut-wrenching)

               Jack!













    Trevor holds her back. She unleashes her torment, punching

    and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now,

    sobbing hysterically.



                                ELLEN

               ... Jack.



    HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...



    CUT TO:



========================================
====================89====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - IN ALLEY - THAT NIGHT

    (APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)



    Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL

    REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.



                                ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER

               Don't beat yourself up too much.

               It was an accident. He was probably

               after a cat... or someone walked

               past back here in the alley.

               Whatever it was, he jumped over the

               fence. What can you do?



    Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.



========================================
====================142====================
    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.

    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.

    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING



    Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless

    walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's

    slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back

    faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes

    a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his

    breathing returns to normal.



    Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the

    dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep

    cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his

    briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches

    the blackboard.



    BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.

    First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

    Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins

    to write per the file folder in his hand...



    "GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S

    MARDSEN..."



    No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the

    class...



                                TREVOR

               ... Before taking roll, I'd like

               to prove a point.



    Now one or two students begin to notice the

    indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...













                                BARSEK

               (Armenian; a disparaging

               laugh)

               'Farfie?'

               (cholo-like)

               Whad up, Farfie?



    Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans

    and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk

    he is exorcising his demons...



                                TREVOR

               ... It's not important what... or

               who... 'Farfie' is.



    Turning to face the class now...



                                TREVOR

               Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay.

               Have a seat, please.



    A handful of students take their seats.



                                TREVOR

               (pacing now)

               The point I'd like to make is

               this... Anyone here can be a

               scientist.



    ... a grudging buzz of confusion.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (sotto; puzzled)

               ... What's he talking about?



                                TREVOR

               ... A scientist is like a

               detective. He investigates data.

               He scratches the surface of things

               he doesn't understand to see

               what's underneath.

               (pointing to blackboard)

               ... Things like this. Okay, who

               wants to read?



    Barsek (the class clown) breaks in...



                                BARSEK

               (standing up)

               I'll do it.



    Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down"

    and "Armenian Power sucks"...











                                TREVOR

               Come on, we don't need disrespect.

               Let 'im do it.

               (to Barsek)

               What's your name?



                                BARSEK

               Barsek.



    A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of

    Trevor's mouth.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, Barsek.     Read.



    (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied

    by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)



                                BARSEK

               ... Glis was very frapper. She

               had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen.

               She couldn't galp a giberter for

               Farfie. Instead she wharked to

               plimp a mardsen binky for him.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, anyone know what Barsek just

               said?



    ... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the

    end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.



                                TREVOR

               That's alright. You don't need to

               understand something to answer a

               few simple questions about it.

               Every one of you is capable of

               decoding data. Watch.



    Trevor writes question #1 on the board...



    1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?



                                TREVOR

               ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can

               anyone tell me?



    The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.



                                TREVOR

               (pointing at

               Asian Girl)

               Okay.











    Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences

    on the board.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (slowly; cautiously)

               ... Glis was frapper... because...

               she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen?



                                TREVOR

               (understated)

               That's right. You got it.

               (reactions all around)

               Let's try another.



    Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...



    2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?



                                TREVOR

               ... What did Glis plimp?



    Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an

    unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."

    Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.

    Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the

    sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.



                                TREVOR

               (searching blackboard

               ledge)

               ... Hold on, hold on. Where's

               your teacher keep the chalk?



                                ASIAN GIRL

               ... In the desk.



    Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A

    startling discovery abruptly halts his search...



    CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.

    Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.



    OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice

    interrupts...



                                CHILDRESS (O.S.)

               ... Can I help you?



    Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in

    the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk

    drawer. You can hear a pin drop.



    Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches

    Trevor.











                                CHILDRESS

               Sorry I'm late. Had to handle

               something. You a sub?



                                TREVOR

               (puzzled)

               I thought this was Science.

               Ms. Eskander.



    Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at

    Trevor's name on the board.



                                CHILDRESS

               No. This is Dave Childress,

               American History.



    Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... Don't know how to break it to

               you...

               (glancing at

               Trevor's name again)

               ... Garfield... but this is

               bungalow 84.



    Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's

    shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.



                                CHILDRESS

               See, you zigged when you shoulda

               zagged. Course it's not your

               fault someone jacked the number

               off my door. Keep askin' Garcia

               to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'



    Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing

    another bungalow across the way.



========================================
====================31====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE



    ... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway

    as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... that mess over there, that's

               Eskander's.



    OFF Trevor's unflinching stare...





========================================
====================39====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOSE ON VENETIAN BLINDS - LATER

    (AFTER SCHOOL)



    as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as

    suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the

    cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.



    A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to

    discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.



                                ELLEN

               May I come in?













                                TREVOR

               Yeah...

               (points at her)

               ... Ellen.



                                ELLENA

               (pointing back)

               Trevor.



    He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged

    over the clock.



                                TREVOR

               (explaining)

               I'm making time a reward instead

               of a distraction.



    Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.



                                ELLEN

               Clever... Listen, I wanted to

               apologize for jumping up like I

               did at lunch. I was just feeling

               a little weird...



                                TREVOR

               It's alright.



                                ELLEN

               For what it's worth, Dave

               Childress thinks you walk on

               water.



                                TREVOR

               Is that a good thing?



    Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.



                                ELLEN

               I think it takes a lot of

               courage to go back into a

               classroom after something like

               that.



                                TREVOR

               Not if the only thing you ever

               wanted to do was teach.



                                ELLEN

               (smiles)

               Now you see, there's our

               predicament.











    WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the

    window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

               I assume you've met Benny Chacon?



                                TREVOR

               I have.



                                ELLEN

               (absently)

               Last week Benny and his tagging

               crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in

               the corner over there.

               (pointing)

               ... She's seven months pregnant

               and he's tormenting her with a

               broom handle... Can I help you

               with those?



    Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

    but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.

    Ellen sees he's in pain.



                                TREVOR

               No thanks.



    She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.



                                ELLEN

               So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

               and if the district construes it

               as assault and battery on a

               student, she's gone.



                                TREVOR

               They'd do that?



                                ELLEN

               In a heart beat. She's non-

               tenured, they don't want to get

               sued...

               (with resignation)

               Don't be surprised if she files

               for stress leave by the end of

               the week. Too bad, too. She's a

               good teacher.



    WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.

    The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.



                                ELLEN

               Can I ask you a personal question?











    Trevor glances up.    Here's what she really wants to

    know...



                                ELLEN

               (tentatively now)

               Why'd that kid attack you?



                                TREVOR

               Because I flunked him.



                                ELLEN

               (sobered)

               Is there any way you can see

               something like that coming?



                                TREVOR

               When they say they wanna kill you,

               you'd best take it serious. This

               kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

               Transfer -- but nobody told me

               until it was too late.



    A beat.



                                ELLEN

               Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

               In less than a year he's been

               convicted of felony assault and

               suspended twice. I even testified

               against him as a character witness.

               Now I get to see him every day in

               homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

               Condition of his probation is

               that he stay in school.



                                TREVOR

               You talk to the principal?



                                ELLEN

               Many times... Three weeks ago,

               Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

               a conference, but she refuses to

               show up. She's afraid they'll

               deport her because she's illegal.

               So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

               some attorney tells her she

               doesn't have to come in.

               (still can't

               believe)

               Garcia got cold feet and dropped

               the whole thing.

               (fear building)

               This kid's threatening me and all

               he's worried about is a lawsuit.











                                TREVOR

               (intent now)

               What'd Benny say to you?



    Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for

    an awkward moment as she collects herself.



                                ELLEN

               That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

               bad.



                                TREVOR

               Does he know where you live?



                                ELLEN

               I think so. Someone's been phoning

               me at night and hanging up... Two

               weeks ago, my car was broken into...

               And last Friday, I think he was

               inside my house... But I can't

               prove it.



    The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the

    bungalow.



                                ELLEN

               (bottom lip quivers)

               ... I don't know what to do.



                                TREVOR

               You can quit.



                                ELLEN

               You didn't.



    OFF Trevor's severe gaze...

    Trevor and Ellen step out of the car.



                                TREVOR

               (tentatively)

               Jack?



    MOVING THROUGH the chain-link fence, into the front yard.

    Ellen whistles faintly. Trevor turns on his flashlight.



                                ELLEN

               Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to

               Mommy, sweetheart.



    The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the

    olive tree.



    Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.



                                ELLEN

               (reacting)

               ... Oh, my God.



    Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts

    pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as

    the flashlight traces the length of the chain...



                                ELLEN

               (right behind Trevor)

               Jack?!



    The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.

    Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.



========================================
====================87====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF ALLEY WALL - JACK



    centered in the flashlight beam, dangling there,

    strangled to death at the end of his dog collar.

    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - ELLEN AND TREVOR - NIGHT



                                ELLEN

               (gut-wrenching)

               Jack!













    Trevor holds her back. She unleashes her torment, punching

    and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now,

    sobbing hysterically.



                                ELLEN

               ... Jack.



    HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...



    CUT TO:



========================================
====================89====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - IN ALLEY - THAT NIGHT

    (APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)



    Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL

    REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.



                                ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER

               Don't beat yourself up too much.

               It was an accident. He was probably

               after a cat... or someone walked

               past back here in the alley.

               Whatever it was, he jumped over the

               fence. What can you do?



    Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.



========================================
====================142====================
    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.

    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.



    V.O. continues through the...







========================================
====================30====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING



    Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless

    walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's

    slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back

    faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes

    a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his

    breathing returns to normal.



    Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the

    dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep

    cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his

    briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches

    the blackboard.



    BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.

    First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

    Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins

    to write per the file folder in his hand...



    "GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S

    MARDSEN..."



    No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the

    class...



                                TREVOR

               ... Before taking roll, I'd like

               to prove a point.



    Now one or two students begin to notice the

    indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...













                                BARSEK

               (Armenian; a disparaging

               laugh)

               'Farfie?'

               (cholo-like)

               Whad up, Farfie?



    Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans

    and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk

    he is exorcising his demons...



                                TREVOR

               ... It's not important what... or

               who... 'Farfie' is.



    Turning to face the class now...



                                TREVOR

               Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay.

               Have a seat, please.



    A handful of students take their seats.



                                TREVOR

               (pacing now)

               The point I'd like to make is

               this... Anyone here can be a

               scientist.



    ... a grudging buzz of confusion.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (sotto; puzzled)

               ... What's he talking about?



                                TREVOR

               ... A scientist is like a

               detective. He investigates data.

               He scratches the surface of things

               he doesn't understand to see

               what's underneath.

               (pointing to blackboard)

               ... Things like this. Okay, who

               wants to read?



    Barsek (the class clown) breaks in...



                                BARSEK

               (standing up)

               I'll do it.



    Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down"

    and "Armenian Power sucks"...











                                TREVOR

               Come on, we don't need disrespect.

               Let 'im do it.

               (to Barsek)

               What's your name?



                                BARSEK

               Barsek.



    A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of

    Trevor's mouth.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, Barsek.     Read.



    (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied

    by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)



                                BARSEK

               ... Glis was very frapper. She

               had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen.

               She couldn't galp a giberter for

               Farfie. Instead she wharked to

               plimp a mardsen binky for him.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, anyone know what Barsek just

               said?



    ... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the

    end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.



                                TREVOR

               That's alright. You don't need to

               understand something to answer a

               few simple questions about it.

               Every one of you is capable of

               decoding data. Watch.



    Trevor writes question #1 on the board...



    1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?



                                TREVOR

               ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can

               anyone tell me?



    The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.



                                TREVOR

               (pointing at

               Asian Girl)

               Okay.











    Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences

    on the board.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (slowly; cautiously)

               ... Glis was frapper... because...

               she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen?



                                TREVOR

               (understated)

               That's right. You got it.

               (reactions all around)

               Let's try another.



    Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...



    2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?



                                TREVOR

               ... What did Glis plimp?



    Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an

    unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."

    Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.

    Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the

    sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.



                                TREVOR

               (searching blackboard

               ledge)

               ... Hold on, hold on. Where's

               your teacher keep the chalk?



                                ASIAN GIRL

               ... In the desk.



    Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A

    startling discovery abruptly halts his search...



    CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.

    Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.



    OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice

    interrupts...



                                CHILDRESS (O.S.)

               ... Can I help you?



    Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in

    the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk

    drawer. You can hear a pin drop.



    Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches

    Trevor.











                                CHILDRESS

               Sorry I'm late. Had to handle

               something. You a sub?



                                TREVOR

               (puzzled)

               I thought this was Science.

               Ms. Eskander.



    Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at

    Trevor's name on the board.



                                CHILDRESS

               No. This is Dave Childress,

               American History.



    Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... Don't know how to break it to

               you...

               (glancing at

               Trevor's name again)

               ... Garfield... but this is

               bungalow 84.



    Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's

    shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.



                                CHILDRESS

               See, you zigged when you shoulda

               zagged. Course it's not your

               fault someone jacked the number

               off my door. Keep askin' Garcia

               to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'



    Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing

    another bungalow across the way.



========================================
====================31====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE



    ... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway

    as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... that mess over there, that's

               Eskander's.



    OFF Trevor's unflinching stare...





========================================
====================39====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOSE ON VENETIAN BLINDS - LATER

    (AFTER SCHOOL)



    as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as

    suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the

    cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.



    A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to

    discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.



                                ELLEN

               May I come in?













                                TREVOR

               Yeah...

               (points at her)

               ... Ellen.



                                ELLENA

               (pointing back)

               Trevor.



    He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged

    over the clock.



                                TREVOR

               (explaining)

               I'm making time a reward instead

               of a distraction.



    Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.



                                ELLEN

               Clever... Listen, I wanted to

               apologize for jumping up like I

               did at lunch. I was just feeling

               a little weird...



                                TREVOR

               It's alright.



                                ELLEN

               For what it's worth, Dave

               Childress thinks you walk on

               water.



                                TREVOR

               Is that a good thing?



    Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.



                                ELLEN

               I think it takes a lot of

               courage to go back into a

               classroom after something like

               that.



                                TREVOR

               Not if the only thing you ever

               wanted to do was teach.



                                ELLEN

               (smiles)

               Now you see, there's our

               predicament.











    WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the

    window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

               I assume you've met Benny Chacon?



                                TREVOR

               I have.



                                ELLEN

               (absently)

               Last week Benny and his tagging

               crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in

               the corner over there.

               (pointing)

               ... She's seven months pregnant

               and he's tormenting her with a

               broom handle... Can I help you

               with those?



    Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

    but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.

    Ellen sees he's in pain.



                                TREVOR

               No thanks.



    She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.



                                ELLEN

               So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

               and if the district construes it

               as assault and battery on a

               student, she's gone.



                                TREVOR

               They'd do that?



                                ELLEN

               In a heart beat. She's non-

               tenured, they don't want to get

               sued...

               (with resignation)

               Don't be surprised if she files

               for stress leave by the end of

               the week. Too bad, too. She's a

               good teacher.



    WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.

    The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.



                                ELLEN

               Can I ask you a personal question?











    Trevor glances up.    Here's what she really wants to

    know...



                                ELLEN

               (tentatively now)

               Why'd that kid attack you?



                                TREVOR

               Because I flunked him.



                                ELLEN

               (sobered)

               Is there any way you can see

               something like that coming?



                                TREVOR

               When they say they wanna kill you,

               you'd best take it serious. This

               kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

               Transfer -- but nobody told me

               until it was too late.



    A beat.



                                ELLEN

               Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

               In less than a year he's been

               convicted of felony assault and

               suspended twice. I even testified

               against him as a character witness.

               Now I get to see him every day in

               homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

               Condition of his probation is

               that he stay in school.



                                TREVOR

               You talk to the principal?



                                ELLEN

               Many times... Three weeks ago,

               Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

               a conference, but she refuses to

               show up. She's afraid they'll

               deport her because she's illegal.

               So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

               some attorney tells her she

               doesn't have to come in.

               (still can't

               believe)

               Garcia got cold feet and dropped

               the whole thing.

               (fear building)

               This kid's threatening me and all

               he's worried about is a lawsuit.











                                TREVOR

               (intent now)

               What'd Benny say to you?



    Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for

    an awkward moment as she collects herself.



                                ELLEN

               That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

               bad.



                                TREVOR

               Does he know where you live?



                                ELLEN

               I think so. Someone's been phoning

               me at night and hanging up... Two

               weeks ago, my car was broken into...

               And last Friday, I think he was

               inside my house... But I can't

               prove it.



    The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the

    bungalow.



                                ELLEN

               (bottom lip quivers)

               ... I don't know what to do.



                                TREVOR

               You can quit.



                                ELLEN

               You didn't.



    OFF Trevor's severe gaze...



========================================

    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - RAMBLER - CONTINUOUS

    ACTION



    Trevor and Ellen step out of the car.



                                TREVOR

               (tentatively)

               Jack?



    MOVING THROUGH the chain-link fence, into the front yard.

    Ellen whistles faintly. Trevor turns on his flashlight.



                                ELLEN

               Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to

               Mommy, sweetheart.



    The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the

    olive tree.



    Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.



                                ELLEN

               (reacting)

               ... Oh, my God.



    Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts

    pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as

    the flashlight traces the length of the chain...



                                ELLEN

               (right behind Trevor)

               Jack?!



    The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.

    Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.



========================================

    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF ALLEY WALL - JACK



    centered in the flashlight beam, dangling there,

               Jack!













    Trevor holds her back. She unleashes her torment, punching

    and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now,

    sobbing hysterically.



                                ELLEN

               ... Jack.



    HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...



    CUT TO:

    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - IN ALLEY - THAT NIGHT

    (APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)



    Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL

    REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.



                                ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER

               Don't beat yourself up too much.

               It was an accident. He was probably

               after a cat... or someone walked

               past back here in the alley.

               Whatever it was, he jumped over the

               fence. What can you do?



    Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.

    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.

    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.

                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.



    V.O. continues through the...







========================================
====================30====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING



    Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless

    walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's

    slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back

    faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes

    a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his

    breathing returns to normal.



    Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the

    dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep

    cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his

    briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches

    the blackboard.



    BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.

    First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

    Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins

    to write per the file folder in his hand...



    "GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S

    MARDSEN..."



    No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the

    class...



                                TREVOR

               ... Before taking roll, I'd like

               to prove a point.



    Now one or two students begin to notice the

    indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...













                                BARSEK

               (Armenian; a disparaging

               laugh)

               'Farfie?'

               (cholo-like)

               Whad up, Farfie?



    Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans

    and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk

    he is exorcising his demons...



                                TREVOR

               ... It's not important what... or

               who... 'Farfie' is.



    Turning to face the class now...



                                TREVOR

               Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay.

               Have a seat, please.



    A handful of students take their seats.



                                TREVOR

               (pacing now)

               The point I'd like to make is

               this... Anyone here can be a

               scientist.



    ... a grudging buzz of confusion.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (sotto; puzzled)

               ... What's he talking about?



                                TREVOR

               ... A scientist is like a

               detective. He investigates data.

               He scratches the surface of things

               he doesn't understand to see

               what's underneath.

               (pointing to blackboard)

               ... Things like this. Okay, who

               wants to read?



    Barsek (the class clown) breaks in...



                                BARSEK

               (standing up)

               I'll do it.



    Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down"

    and "Armenian Power sucks"...











                                TREVOR

               Come on, we don't need disrespect.

               Let 'im do it.

               (to Barsek)

               What's your name?



                                BARSEK

               Barsek.



    A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of

    Trevor's mouth.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, Barsek.     Read.



    (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied

    by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)



                                BARSEK

               ... Glis was very frapper. She

               had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen.

               She couldn't galp a giberter for

               Farfie. Instead she wharked to

               plimp a mardsen binky for him.



                                TREVOR

               Okay, anyone know what Barsek just

               said?



    ... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the

    end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.



                                TREVOR

               That's alright. You don't need to

               understand something to answer a

               few simple questions about it.

               Every one of you is capable of

               decoding data. Watch.



    Trevor writes question #1 on the board...



    1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?



                                TREVOR

               ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can

               anyone tell me?



    The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.



                                TREVOR

               (pointing at

               Asian Girl)

               Okay.











    Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences

    on the board.



                                ASIAN GIRL

               (slowly; cautiously)

               ... Glis was frapper... because...

               she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen?



                                TREVOR

               (understated)

               That's right. You got it.

               (reactions all around)

               Let's try another.



    Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...



    2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?



                                TREVOR

               ... What did Glis plimp?



    Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an

    unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."

    Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.

    Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the

    sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.



                                TREVOR

               (searching blackboard

               ledge)

               ... Hold on, hold on. Where's

               your teacher keep the chalk?



                                ASIAN GIRL

               ... In the desk.



    Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A

    startling discovery abruptly halts his search...



    CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.

    Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.



    OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice

    interrupts...



                                CHILDRESS (O.S.)

               ... Can I help you?



    Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in

    the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk

    drawer. You can hear a pin drop.



    Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches

    Trevor.











                                CHILDRESS

               Sorry I'm late. Had to handle

               something. You a sub?



                                TREVOR

               (puzzled)

               I thought this was Science.

               Ms. Eskander.



    Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at

    Trevor's name on the board.



                                CHILDRESS

               No. This is Dave Childress,

               American History.



    Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... Don't know how to break it to

               you...

               (glancing at

               Trevor's name again)

               ... Garfield... but this is

               bungalow 84.



    Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's

    shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.



                                CHILDRESS

               See, you zigged when you shoulda

               zagged. Course it's not your

               fault someone jacked the number

               off my door. Keep askin' Garcia

               to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'



    Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing

    another bungalow across the way.



========================================
====================31====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE



    ... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway

    as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.



                                CHILDRESS

               ... that mess over there, that's

               Eskander's.



    OFF Trevor's unflinching stare...





========================================
====================39====================
    :SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOSE ON VENETIAN BLINDS - LATER

    (AFTER SCHOOL)



    as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as

    suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the

    cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.



    A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to

    discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.



                                ELLEN

               May I come in?













                                TREVOR

               Yeah...

               (points at her)

               ... Ellen.



                                ELLENA

               (pointing back)

               Trevor.



    He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged

    over the clock.



                                TREVOR

               (explaining)

               I'm making time a reward instead

               of a distraction.



    Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.



                                ELLEN

               Clever... Listen, I wanted to

               apologize for jumping up like I

               did at lunch. I was just feeling

               a little weird...



                                TREVOR

               It's alright.



                                ELLEN

               For what it's worth, Dave

               Childress thinks you walk on

               water.



                                TREVOR

               Is that a good thing?



    Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.



                                ELLEN

               I think it takes a lot of

               courage to go back into a

               classroom after something like

               that.



                                TREVOR

               Not if the only thing you ever

               wanted to do was teach.



                                ELLEN

               (smiles)

               Now you see, there's our

               predicament.











    WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the

    window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

               I assume you've met Benny Chacon?



                                TREVOR

               I have.



                                ELLEN

               (absently)

               Last week Benny and his tagging

               crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in

               the corner over there.

               (pointing)

               ... She's seven months pregnant

               and he's tormenting her with a

               broom handle... Can I help you

               with those?



    Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

    but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.

    Ellen sees he's in pain.



                                TREVOR

               No thanks.



    She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.



                                ELLEN

               So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

               and if the district construes it

               as assault and battery on a

               student, she's gone.



                                TREVOR

               They'd do that?



                                ELLEN

               In a heart beat. She's non-

               tenured, they don't want to get

               sued...

               (with resignation)

               Don't be surprised if she files

               for stress leave by the end of

               the week. Too bad, too. She's a

               good teacher.



    WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.

    The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.



                                ELLEN

               Can I ask you a personal question?











    Trevor glances up.    Here's what she really wants to

    know...



                                ELLEN

               (tentatively now)

               Why'd that kid attack you?



                                TREVOR

               Because I flunked him.



                                ELLEN

               (sobered)

               Is there any way you can see

               something like that coming?



                                TREVOR

               When they say they wanna kill you,

               you'd best take it serious. This

               kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

               Transfer -- but nobody told me

               until it was too late.



    A beat.



                                ELLEN

               Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

               In less than a year he's been

               convicted of felony assault and

               suspended twice. I even testified

               against him as a character witness.

               Now I get to see him every day in

               homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

               Condition of his probation is

               that he stay in school.



                                TREVOR

               You talk to the principal?



                                ELLEN

               Many times... Three weeks ago,

               Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

               a conference, but she refuses to

               show up. She's afraid they'll

               deport her because she's illegal.

               So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

               some attorney tells her she

               doesn't have to come in.

               (still can't

               believe)

               Garcia got cold feet and dropped

               the whole thing.

               (fear building)

               This kid's threatening me and all

               he's worried about is a lawsuit.











                                TREVOR

               (intent now)

               What'd Benny say to you?



    Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for

    an awkward moment as she collects herself.



                                ELLEN

               That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

               bad.



                                TREVOR

               Does he know where you live?



                                ELLEN

               I think so. Someone's been phoning

               me at night and hanging up... Two

               weeks ago, my car was broken into...

               And last Friday, I think he was

               inside my house... But I can't

               prove it.



    The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the

    bungalow.



                                ELLEN

               (bottom lip quivers)

               ... I don't know what to do.



                                TREVOR

               You can quit.



                                ELLEN

               You didn't.



    OFF Trevor's severe gaze...



========================================
====================86====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - RAMBLER - CONTINUOUS

    ACTION



    Trevor and Ellen step out of the car.



                                TREVOR

               (tentatively)

               Jack?



    MOVING THROUGH the chain-link fence, into the front yard.

    Ellen whistles faintly. Trevor turns on his flashlight.



                                ELLEN

               Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to

               Mommy, sweetheart.



    The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the

    olive tree.



    Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.



                                ELLEN

               (reacting)

               ... Oh, my God.



    Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts

    pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as

    the flashlight traces the length of the chain...



                                ELLEN

               (right behind Trevor)

               Jack?!



    The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.

    Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.



========================================
====================87====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF ALLEY WALL - JACK



    centered in the flashlight beam, dangling there,

    strangled to death at the end of his dog collar.

               (gut-wrenching)

               Jack!













    Trevor holds her back. She unleashes her torment, punching

    and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now,

    sobbing hysterically.



                                ELLEN

               ... Jack.



    HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...



    CUT TO:



========================================
====================89====================
    :SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - IN ALLEY - THAT NIGHT

    (APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)



    Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL

    REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.



                                ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER

               Don't beat yourself up too much.

               It was an accident. He was probably

               after a cat... or someone walked

               past back here in the alley.

               Whatever it was, he jumped over the

               fence. What can you do?



    Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.



========================================
====================142====================
    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.

    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.



    V.O. continues through the...







========================================
====================142====================
    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.



    V.O. continues through the...
