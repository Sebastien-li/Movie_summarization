               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 

               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.



               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 

               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 

               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 

               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.



               She enters the DRUGSTORE.

               :SC: EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY



               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 

               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 

               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 

               MURDERING."



                                     LONE PROTESTER

                         (chanting in extremely 

                         shy, accented voice)

                         All babies want to get borned! All 

                         babies want to get borned!



               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.



                                     JUNO

                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?



                                     JUNO

                         Good. I'm good.

                         (pause)

                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 

                         class yet?



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 

                         little last night, but I'm having 

                         trouble concentrating.



                                     JUNO

                         You should try Adderall.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No thanks. I'm off pills.



                                     JUNO

                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 

                         a huge crazy freakout because she 

                         took too many behavioral meds at 

                         once. She took off her clothes and 

                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 

                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 

                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"



                                     SU-CHIN

                         I heard that was you.



                                     JUNO

                         Well, it was nice seeing you.



               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         (calling out)

                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 

                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 

                         And it has fingernails.



                                     JUNO

                         Really? Fingernails?



               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 

               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 

               women, teens and ill-behaved children.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 

                         women are trusted friends. Please 

                         put your hands where I can see them 

                         and surrender any bombs.



               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.



                                     JUNO

                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Your name, please?



                                     JUNO

                         Juno MacGuff.



               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 

               paperwork on a clipboard.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 

                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.



               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         I need you to fill these out, both 

                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 

                         details. We need to know about every 

                         score and every sore.



               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 

               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Would you like some free condoms? 

                         They're boysenberry.



                                     JUNO

                         No thank you. I'm off sex.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         My partner uses these every time we 

                         have intercourse. They make his balls 

                         smell like pie.



                                     JUNO

                         Congrats.



               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 

               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 

               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 

               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 

               moments.



               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 

               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 

               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.



               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 

               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 

               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 

               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 

               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 

               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...



               CUT TO:



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?



               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.



               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 

               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 

               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 

               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY



               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 

               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 

               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 

               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.



               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 

               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.



                                     VANESSA

                         Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno 

                         and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         Vanessa, right?



                                     MAC

                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 

                         my irresponsible child over to your 

                         home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

                                     VANESSA

                         Can I take your coats?



                                     JUNO

                         Sure.



               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 

               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.



                                     JUNO

                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 

                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 

                         other people with the fake woods in 

                         the background. Like I'm really going 

                         to fall for that, you know?



                                     VANESSA

                         You found us in the Penny Saver?



               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 

               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.



               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 

               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.



                                     MARK

                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 

               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 

               grin.



                                     MARK

                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.

                         Nope. We're safe.



               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

                         Cool.

                         Come on, I have something for you.



               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 

               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 

               to illuminate a bare bulb.



                                     JUNO

                         old comics down here, and I want to 

                         show you one of them.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...



                                     MARK

                         You're gonna like this, I promise.



               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.



                                     MARK

                         (extracting a bagged 

                         COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                         (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                         (growing)

                         No.



                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.



                                     MARK

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...



                                     JUNO

                         (interrupting)

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 

                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 

                         else's family. Listen, once I have 

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!



                                     MARK

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.



                                     JUNO

                         (aghast)

                         But you're old!



                                     MARK

                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 

                         Why are you here?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.



                                     MARK

                         This...

                         (he gestures to the 

                         dank surrounding 

                         room)

                         ...this is what my life has become. 

                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 

                         Is that so appealing to you?



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         God, you're so young.



                                     JUNO

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.



========================================
====================89====================
               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON



               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 

               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.



========================================
====================7====================
               :SC: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING



               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 

               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 

               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 

               fashion a noose.



               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 

               prairie grass and wild flowers.



========================================
====================3====================
               :SC: EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY



               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 

               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.



               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 

               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 

               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 

               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.



               She enters the DRUGSTORE.



========================================
====================31====================
               :SC: EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY



               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 

               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 

               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 

               MURDERING."



                                     LONE PROTESTER

                         (chanting in extremely 

                         shy, accented voice)

                         All babies want to get borned! All 

                         babies want to get borned!



               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.



                                     JUNO

                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?



                                     JUNO

                         Good. I'm good.

                         (pause)

                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 

                         class yet?



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 

                         little last night, but I'm having 

                         trouble concentrating.



                                     JUNO

                         You should try Adderall.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No thanks. I'm off pills.



                                     JUNO

                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 

                         a huge crazy freakout because she 

                         took too many behavioral meds at 

                         once. She took off her clothes and 

                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 

                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 

                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"



                                     SU-CHIN

                         I heard that was you.



                                     JUNO

                         Well, it was nice seeing you.



               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         (calling out)

                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 

                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 

                         And it has fingernails.



                                     JUNO

                         Really? Fingernails?



               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               :SC: INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY



               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 

               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 

               women, teens and ill-behaved children.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 

                         women are trusted friends. Please 

                         put your hands where I can see them 

                         and surrender any bombs.



               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.



                                     JUNO

                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Your name, please?



                                     JUNO

                         Juno MacGuff.



               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 

               paperwork on a clipboard.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 

                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.



               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         I need you to fill these out, both 

                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 

                         details. We need to know about every 

                         score and every sore.



               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 

               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Would you like some free condoms? 

                         They're boysenberry.



                                     JUNO

                         No thank you. I'm off sex.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         My partner uses these every time we 

                         have intercourse. They make his balls 

                         smell like pie.



                                     JUNO

                         Congrats.



               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 

               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 

               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 

               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 

               moments.



               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 

               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 

               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.



               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 

               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 

               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 

               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 

               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 

               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...



               CUT TO:



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?



               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.



               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 

               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 

               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 

               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY



               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 

               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 

               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 

               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.



               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 

               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.



                                     VANESSA

                         Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno 

                         and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         Vanessa, right?



                                     MAC

                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 

                         my irresponsible child over to your 

                         home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Can I take your coats?



                                     JUNO

                         Sure.



               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 

               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.



                                     JUNO

                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 

                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 

                         other people with the fake woods in 

                         the background. Like I'm really going 

                         to fall for that, you know?



                                     VANESSA

                         You found us in the Penny Saver?



               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 

               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.



               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 

               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.



                                     MARK

                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 

               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 

               grin.



                                     MARK

                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.



                                     JUNO

                         (furtive)

                         Is Vanessa here?



                                     MARK

                         Nope. We're safe.



               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.



                                     JUNO

                         Cool.



                                     MARK

                         Come on, I have something for you.



               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               :SC: INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON



               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 

               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 

               to illuminate a bare bulb.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 

                         It's beautiful!



                                     MARK

                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 

                         old comics down here, and I want to 

                         show you one of them.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...



                                     MARK

                         You're gonna like this, I promise.



               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.



                                     MARK

                         (extracting a bagged 

                         COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                         (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                         (growing)

                         No.



                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.



                                     MARK

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...



                                     JUNO

                         (interrupting)

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 

                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 

                         else's family. Listen, once I have 

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.



                                     JUNO

                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 

                         Why are you here?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.



                                     MARK

                         This...

                         (he gestures to the 

                         dank surrounding 

                         room)

                         ...this is what my life has become. 

                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 

                         Is that so appealing to you?



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         God, you're so young.



                                     JUNO

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.



========================================
====================89====================
               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON



               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 

               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.



========================================
====================7====================
               :SC: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING



               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 

               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 

               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 

               fashion a noose.



               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 

               prairie grass and wild flowers.



========================================
====================3====================
               :SC: EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY



               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 

               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.



               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 

               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 

               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 

               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.



               She enters the DRUGSTORE.



========================================
====================31====================
               :SC: EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY



               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 

               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 

               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 

               MURDERING."



                                     LONE PROTESTER

                         (chanting in extremely 

                         shy, accented voice)

                         All babies want to get borned! All 

                         babies want to get borned!



               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.



                                     JUNO

                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?



                                     JUNO

                         Good. I'm good.

                         (pause)

                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 

                         class yet?



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 

                         little last night, but I'm having 

                         trouble concentrating.



                                     JUNO

                         You should try Adderall.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No thanks. I'm off pills.



                                     JUNO

                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 

                         a huge crazy freakout because she 

                         took too many behavioral meds at 

                         once. She took off her clothes and 

                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 

                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 

                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"



                                     SU-CHIN

                         I heard that was you.



                                     JUNO

                         Well, it was nice seeing you.



               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         (calling out)

                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 

                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 

                         And it has fingernails.



                                     JUNO

                         Really? Fingernails?



               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               :SC: INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY



               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 

               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 

               women, teens and ill-behaved children.

                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 

                         women are trusted friends. Please 

                         put your hands where I can see them 

                         and surrender any bombs.



               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.



                                     JUNO

                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Your name, please?



                                     JUNO

                         Juno MacGuff.



               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 

               paperwork on a clipboard.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 

                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.



               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         I need you to fill these out, both 

                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 

                         details. We need to know about every 

                         score and every sore.



               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 

               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Would you like some free condoms? 

                         They're boysenberry.

                         No thank you. I'm off sex.

                         My partner uses these every time we 

                         have intercourse. They make his balls 

                         smell like pie.



                                     JUNO

                         Congrats.



               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 

               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 

               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 

               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 

               moments.



               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 

               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 

               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.



               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 

               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 

               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 

               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 

               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 

               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...



               CUT TO:



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?



               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.



               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 

               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 

               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 

               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 

               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 

               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 

               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.



               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 

               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.



                                     VANESSA

                         Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno 

                         and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         Vanessa, right?



                                     MAC

                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 

                         my irresponsible child over to your 

                         home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Can I take your coats?



                                     JUNO

                         Sure.



               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 

               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.



                                     JUNO

                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 

                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 

                         other people with the fake woods in 

                         the background. Like I'm really going 

                         to fall for that, you know?



                                     VANESSA

                         You found us in the Penny Saver?



               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 

               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.



               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 

               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.



                                     MARK

                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 

               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 

               grin.



                                     MARK

                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.



                                     JUNO

                         (furtive)

                         Is Vanessa here?



                                     MARK

                         Nope. We're safe.



               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.



                                     JUNO

                         Cool.



                                     MARK

                         Come on, I have something for you.



               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 

               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 

               to illuminate a bare bulb.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 

                         It's beautiful!



                                     MARK

                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 

                         old comics down here, and I want to 

                         show you one of them.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...



                                     MARK

                         You're gonna like this, I promise.



               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.



                                     MARK

                         (extracting a bagged 

                         COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                         (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                         (growing)

                         No.



                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...



                                     JUNO

                         (interrupting)

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 

                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 

                         else's family. Listen, once I have 

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.

                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 

                         Why are you here?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.

                         dank surrounding 

                         room)

                         ...this is what my life has become. 

                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 

                         Is that so appealing to you?



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         God, you're so young.



                                     JUNO

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.



========================================
====================89====================
               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON



               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 

               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.



========================================
====================7====================
               :SC: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING



               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 

               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 

               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 

               fashion a noose.



               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 

               prairie grass and wild flowers.



========================================
====================3====================
               :SC: EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY



               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 

               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.



               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 

               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 

               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 

               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.



               She enters the DRUGSTORE.

====================31====================
               :SC: EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY



               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 

               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 

               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 

               MURDERING."



                                     LONE PROTESTER

                         (chanting in extremely 

                         shy, accented voice)

                         All babies want to get borned! All 

                         babies want to get borned!



               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.



                                     JUNO

                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?



                                     JUNO

                         Good. I'm good.

                         (pause)

                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 

                         class yet?



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 

                         little last night, but I'm having 

                         trouble concentrating.



                                     JUNO

                         You should try Adderall.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         No thanks. I'm off pills.



                                     JUNO

                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 

                         a huge crazy freakout because she 

                         took too many behavioral meds at 

                         once. She took off her clothes and 

                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 

                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 

                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"



                                     SU-CHIN

                         I heard that was you.



                                     JUNO

                         Well, it was nice seeing you.



               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.



                                     SU-CHIN

                         (calling out)

                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 

                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 

                         And it has fingernails.



                                     JUNO

                         Really? Fingernails?



               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               :SC: INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY



               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 

               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 

               women, teens and ill-behaved children.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 

                         women are trusted friends. Please 

                         put your hands where I can see them 

                         and surrender any bombs.



               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.



                                     JUNO

                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Your name, please?



                                     JUNO

                         Juno MacGuff.



               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 

               paperwork on a clipboard.



                                     JUNO (V.O.)

                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 

                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.



               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         I need you to fill these out, both 

                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 

                         details. We need to know about every 

                         score and every sore.



               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 

               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Would you like some free condoms? 

                         They're boysenberry.



                                     JUNO

                         No thank you. I'm off sex.



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         My partner uses these every time we 

                         have intercourse. They make his balls 

                         smell like pie.



                                     JUNO

                         Congrats.



               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 

               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 

               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 

               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 

               moments.



               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 

               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 

               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.



               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 

               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 

               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 

               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 

               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 

               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...



               CUT TO:



                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?



               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.



               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 

               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 

               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 

               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY



               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 

               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 

               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 

               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.



               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 

               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.



                                     VANESSA

                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 

                         my irresponsible child over to your 

                         home.



                                     VANESSA

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.



                                     VANESSA

                         Can I take your coats?



                                     JUNO

                         Sure.



               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 

               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.



                                     JUNO

                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 

                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 

                         other people with the fake woods in 

                         the background. Like I'm really going 

                         to fall for that, you know?



                                     VANESSA

                         You found us in the Penny Saver?



               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 

               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.



               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 

               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.



                                     MARK

                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.



========================================
====================86====================
               :SC: INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY



               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 

               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 

               grin.



                                     MARK

                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.



                                     JUNO

                         (furtive)

                         Is Vanessa here?



                                     MARK

                         Nope. We're safe.



               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.



                                     JUNO

                         Cool.



                                     MARK

                         Come on, I have something for you.



               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               :SC: INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON



               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 

               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 

               to illuminate a bare bulb.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 

                         It's beautiful!



                                     MARK

                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 

                         old comics down here, and I want to 

                         show you one of them.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...



                                     MARK

                         You're gonna like this, I promise.



               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.



                                     MARK

                         (extracting a bagged 

                         COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                         (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                         (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                         (growing)

                         No.



                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.



                                     MARK

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...



                                     JUNO

                         (interrupting)

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 

                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 

                         else's family. Listen, once I have 

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!



                                     MARK

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.



                                     JUNO

                         (aghast)

                         But you're old!



                                     MARK

                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 

                         Why are you here?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.



                                     MARK

                         This...

                         (he gestures to the 

                         dank surrounding 

                         room)

                         ...this is what my life has become. 

                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 

                         Is that so appealing to you?



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         God, you're so young.



                                     JUNO

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

               :SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON



               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 

               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

               :SC: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING



               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 

               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 

               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 

               fashion a noose.



               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 

               prairie grass and wild flowers.
