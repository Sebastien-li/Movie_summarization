INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER



Zoe closes the door behind her.



                      ZOE

            Hallelujah!





As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices

someone entering the cab from the other side.



This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --

faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.



                      STAN

            You own it?



                      ZOE

            No, but I'm about to rent it.



                      STAN

            Actually, if we're being technical,

            you kind of stole it.



                      ZOE

            I don't think so.



                      STAN

            If you see someone about to get in

            a cab, you can't just run in from

            the other side and say it's yours.



                      ZOE

            I didn't see you.



                      STAN

            I saw you see me.



                      ZOE

            (to the cabbie)

            Sir, who saw you first?



The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.



                      STAN

            Maybe you're not from around here,

            but there's a code. It's like war,

            even though it's brutal and bloody,

            there are still certain rules we--



                      ZOE

            Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.



Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            But not because you're right, but

            because I am in a terrific mood,

            and you are ruining it.





                      STAN

            No.   I'll get out.



They each get out.



========================================
====================10====================
EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS



Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the

POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.



                      ZOE

            Now what?



                      STAN

            I don't know. You tell me.



That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.



                      ZOE

            What? Where's he going?!

            (waving her hands, then)

            Come back!



They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Well, that was stupid. Why'd you

            get out, you, stupid-head?



                      STAN

            You said you were in a great mood

            and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

            (then)

            Did you just call me stupid-head?



Zoe storms off with her little steps.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================41====================
EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT



Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is

practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.



                      STAN

            My singing made you vomit.



                      ZOE

            No.    It's not that.



                      STAN

            Sure, we were a little out of tune,

            but...



                      ZOE

            I really don't feel well.



                      STAN

            Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?



ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.

Zoe's face pales.



                      CAROL

            Zoe?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...



                      CAROL

            Where have you been?    You haven't

            been coming to any--



                      ZOE

            (cutting her off)

            Right. I know. I've been so busy.

            Next one, I'm there. For sure.

            (then, awkward)

            This is my friend, Stan.





                      STAN

            Hi.



                      CAROL

            (eyeing Stan suspiciously)

            Hello. Are you two--



                      ZOE

            Late. Yes. We are. We really

            are.

            (pushing Stan along)

            I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.



They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.



                      STAN

            An old...boyfriend?



                      ZOE

            Her name is Carol. We're on

            a...committee together.



They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder

to make sure Carol's gone.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            All right. I have to go to bed

            now. I'll call you, okay?



                      STAN

            Okay.

            (then)

            Hey, I was thinking, if you don't

            have any plans this weekend, maybe

            you'd like to come up to the farm

            and get away for a few days.



                      ZOE

            I'll call you tomorrow.

            Something's not agreeing with me.



                      STAN

            Was it the lamb's tongue?



Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands

there for a beat. He calls after her.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Okay, well...this weekend.   Think

            about it.





========================================
====================82====================
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to

face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the

little bump, new since he's last been with her.



                      STAN

            Do you feel any kicking?



                      ZOE

            Sometimes.



                      STAN

            What does it feel like?



                      ZOE

            Like butterflies.





Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her

belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Are you really sure you want to do

            this?



                      STAN

            Yeah.     I'm really sure.



They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes

her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as

she dozes off.



========================================
====================106====================
EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY



14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to

unload their wares.



Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like

soldiers back from battle.



                      ZOE

            Wow. We really shouldn't have seen

            that.



                      STAN

            No.



                      ZOE

            I did mention that I barely know

            those people, right?



                      STAN

            Like forty times.



                      ZOE

            I feel the need to say it again.



They turn into the Farmer's Market.



ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little

Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.



                      STAN

            It won't be like that for us.



                      ZOE

            How do you know?



                      STAN

            Well, for starters, you wax.



ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese

stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on

Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Oh, hi.





                      STAN

            Hi.

            (awkward beat, then)

            You remember Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Right, hi.



And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            Wow.

            (then, to Stan)

            Wow.



At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It

says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.



                      ZOE

            What is that supposed to mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's nothing.



Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)

            I had no idea it was that serious.



                      STAN

            I told you it was serious.



                      ZOE

            (interrupting)

            What the hell does, "sorry about

            last night" mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's stupid. I was drunk and...



                      STAN

            It was nothing.



                      ZOE

            What was nothing?



Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.



                      OLIVIA

            You're having a baby? I didn't

            know you'd been together that long.





                      STAN

            Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,

            we're having a baby. Two actually.



On Zoe's look of shock we...



CUT TO:



========================================
====================107====================
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER



The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe

runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened.



                      ZOE

            Get away from me.



Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened!



                      ZOE

            You said, "they're not mine."



                      STAN

            I didn't mean to say it.



                      ZOE

            How could you say that?



                      STAN

            I don't know. I was flustered.



                      ZOE

            Flustered?



                      STAN

            I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking

            straight. I've been up all night

            watching Orca give birth!



                      ZOE

            (incredulous)

            "They're not mine?"



                      STAN

            (at a loss )

            Well, I mean...technically, they're

            not.





The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.

Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            You know, all this time you're

            trying to figure out who the real

            me is, but who the fuck are you?



                      STAN

            Zoe.



She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.



========================================
====================111====================
EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY



Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the

sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.



                      ZOE

            What.



                      STAN

            It's Thursday. We have a doctor's

            appointment.



                      ZOE

            There is no "we", Stan.



                      STAN

            Come on, I didn't mean to say it,

            and that's not how I feel.



Zoe shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            I made a mistake trusting you.



                      STAN

            Don't say that.     That's not true.



                      ZOE

            You're not good for me. You made

            me think I needed you, and I don't.





                      STAN

            So that's it? Because of one

            stupid, asinine thing that I said,

            it's all over? This is how it

            ends?



                      ZOE

            Yes.  This is how it ends.

            (then)

            I don't know why you're so

            surprised. I told you, nothing

            lasts forever.



Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.



========================================
====================131====================
INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY



They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.



                      ZOE

            Who knew you were such a romantic.





                      STAN

            Well, it's the anniversary of our

            first date. Where else would I

            take you?

            (then)

            Cheers.



They clink dogs and each take a bite.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            What a year, huh?



                      ZOE

            Incredible. Wouldn't change a

            thing. Well, except for the part

            where you dumped me.



                      STAN

            And the part where you dumped me.

            (to the babies)

            Girls...Mommy and Daddy were

            stupid.



The babies smile and coo.



                      ZOE

            (baby-talk)

            Yes, we were. Yes, we were.



                      STAN

            The first time we held hands was in

            here. It started out as a high-

            five, but then I strategically

            turned into a hand-hold.



                      ZOE

            How do you remember that?



                      STAN

            We both agreed that we were totally

            sick of weddings and hated when

            people wrote their own vows.



                      ZOE

            That's right. I remember that.



                      STAN

            So...I hope you won't hold it

            against me.



                      ZOE

            What?





Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at

them, confused.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What are you doing here?



And then Bobby comes through the door.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Bobby?



And then Mona.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's happening?



And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori

and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.

And we...

INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER



Zoe closes the door behind her.



                      ZOE

            Hallelujah!





As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices

someone entering the cab from the other side.



This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --

faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.



                      STAN

            You own it?



                      ZOE

            No, but I'm about to rent it.



                      STAN

            Actually, if we're being technical,

            you kind of stole it.



                      ZOE

            I don't think so.



                      STAN

            If you see someone about to get in

            a cab, you can't just run in from

            the other side and say it's yours.



                      ZOE

            I didn't see you.



                      STAN

            I saw you see me.



                      ZOE

            (to the cabbie)

            Sir, who saw you first?



The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.



                      STAN

            Maybe you're not from around here,

            but there's a code. It's like war,

            even though it's brutal and bloody,

            there are still certain rules we--



                      ZOE

            Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.



Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            But not because you're right, but

            because I am in a terrific mood,

            and you are ruining it.





                      STAN

            No.   I'll get out.



They each get out.



========================================
====================10====================
EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS



Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the

POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.



                      ZOE

            Now what?



                      STAN

            I don't know. You tell me.



That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.



                      ZOE

            What? Where's he going?!

            (waving her hands, then)

            Come back!



They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Well, that was stupid. Why'd you

            get out, you, stupid-head?



                      STAN

            You said you were in a great mood

            and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

            (then)

            Did you just call me stupid-head?



Zoe storms off with her little steps.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================41====================
EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT



Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is

practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.



                      STAN

            My singing made you vomit.



                      ZOE

            No.    It's not that.



                      STAN

            Sure, we were a little out of tune,

            but...



                      ZOE

            I really don't feel well.



                      STAN

            Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?



ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.

Zoe's face pales.



                      CAROL

            Zoe?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...



                      CAROL

            Where have you been?    You haven't

            been coming to any--



                      ZOE

            (cutting her off)

            Right. I know. I've been so busy.

            Next one, I'm there. For sure.

            (then, awkward)

            This is my friend, Stan.





                      STAN

            Hi.



                      CAROL

            (eyeing Stan suspiciously)

            Hello. Are you two--



                      ZOE

            Late. Yes. We are. We really

            are.

            (pushing Stan along)

            I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.



They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.



                      STAN

            An old...boyfriend?



                      ZOE

            Her name is Carol. We're on

            a...committee together.



They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder

to make sure Carol's gone.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            All right. I have to go to bed

            now. I'll call you, okay?



                      STAN

            Okay.

            (then)

            Hey, I was thinking, if you don't

            have any plans this weekend, maybe

            you'd like to come up to the farm

            and get away for a few days.



                      ZOE

            I'll call you tomorrow.

            Something's not agreeing with me.



                      STAN

            Was it the lamb's tongue?



Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands

there for a beat. He calls after her.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Okay, well...this weekend.   Think

            about it.





========================================
====================82====================
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to

face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the

little bump, new since he's last been with her.



                      STAN

            Do you feel any kicking?



                      ZOE

            Sometimes.



                      STAN

            What does it feel like?



                      ZOE

            Like butterflies.





Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her

belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Are you really sure you want to do

            this?



                      STAN

            Yeah.     I'm really sure.



They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes

her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as

she dozes off.



========================================
====================106====================
EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY



14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to

unload their wares.



Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like

soldiers back from battle.



                      ZOE

            Wow. We really shouldn't have seen

            that.



                      STAN

            No.



                      ZOE

            I did mention that I barely know

            those people, right?



                      STAN

            Like forty times.



                      ZOE

            I feel the need to say it again.



They turn into the Farmer's Market.



ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little

Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.



                      STAN

            It won't be like that for us.



                      ZOE

            How do you know?



                      STAN

            Well, for starters, you wax.



ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese

stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on

Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Oh, hi.





                      STAN

            Hi.

            (awkward beat, then)

            You remember Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Right, hi.



And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            Wow.

            (then, to Stan)

            Wow.



At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It

says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.



                      ZOE

            What is that supposed to mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's nothing.



Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)

            I had no idea it was that serious.



                      STAN

            I told you it was serious.



                      ZOE

            (interrupting)

            What the hell does, "sorry about

            last night" mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's stupid. I was drunk and...



                      STAN

            It was nothing.



                      ZOE

            What was nothing?



Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.



                      OLIVIA

            You're having a baby? I didn't

            know you'd been together that long.





                      STAN

            Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,

            we're having a baby. Two actually.



On Zoe's look of shock we...



CUT TO:



========================================
====================107====================
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER



The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe

runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened.



                      ZOE

            Get away from me.



Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened!



                      ZOE

            You said, "they're not mine."



                      STAN

            I didn't mean to say it.



                      ZOE

            How could you say that?



                      STAN

            I don't know. I was flustered.



                      ZOE

            Flustered?



                      STAN

            I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking

            straight. I've been up all night

            watching Orca give birth!



                      ZOE

            (incredulous)

            "They're not mine?"



                      STAN

            (at a loss )

            Well, I mean...technically, they're

            not.





The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.

Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            You know, all this time you're

            trying to figure out who the real

            me is, but who the fuck are you?



                      STAN

            Zoe.



She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.



========================================

EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY



Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the

sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.



                      ZOE

            What.



                      STAN

            It's Thursday. We have a doctor's

            appointment.



                      ZOE

            There is no "we", Stan.



                      STAN

            Come on, I didn't mean to say it,

            and that's not how I feel.



Zoe shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            I made a mistake trusting you.



                      STAN

            Don't say that.     That's not true.



                      ZOE

            You're not good for me. You made

            me think I needed you, and I don't.





                      STAN

            So that's it? Because of one

            stupid, asinine thing that I said,

            it's all over? This is how it

            ends?



                      ZOE

            Yes.  This is how it ends.

            (then)

            I don't know why you're so

            surprised. I told you, nothing

            lasts forever.



Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.



========================================
====================131====================
INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY



They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.



                      ZOE

            Who knew you were such a romantic.





                      STAN

            Well, it's the anniversary of our

            first date. Where else would I

            take you?

            (then)

            Cheers.



They clink dogs and each take a bite.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            What a year, huh?



                      ZOE

            Incredible. Wouldn't change a

            thing. Well, except for the part

            where you dumped me.



                      STAN

            And the part where you dumped me.

            (to the babies)

            Girls...Mommy and Daddy were

            stupid.



The babies smile and coo.



                      ZOE

            (baby-talk)

            Yes, we were. Yes, we were.



                      STAN

            The first time we held hands was in

            here. It started out as a high-

            five, but then I strategically

            turned into a hand-hold.



                      ZOE

            How do you remember that?



                      STAN

            We both agreed that we were totally

            sick of weddings and hated when

            people wrote their own vows.



                      ZOE

            That's right. I remember that.



                      STAN

            So...I hope you won't hold it

            against me.



                      ZOE

            What?





Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at

them, confused.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What are you doing here?



And then Bobby comes through the door.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Bobby?



And then Mona.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's happening?



And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori

and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.

And we...



DISSOLVE TO:



========================================
====================9====================
INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER



Zoe closes the door behind her.



                      ZOE

            Hallelujah!





As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices

someone entering the cab from the other side.



This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --

faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.



                      STAN

            You own it?



                      ZOE

            No, but I'm about to rent it.



                      STAN

            Actually, if we're being technical,

            you kind of stole it.



                      ZOE

            I don't think so.



                      STAN

            If you see someone about to get in

            a cab, you can't just run in from

            the other side and say it's yours.



                      ZOE

            I didn't see you.



                      STAN

            I saw you see me.



                      ZOE

            (to the cabbie)

            Sir, who saw you first?



The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.



                      STAN

            Maybe you're not from around here,

            but there's a code. It's like war,

            even though it's brutal and bloody,

            there are still certain rules we--



                      ZOE

            Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.



Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            But not because you're right, but

            because I am in a terrific mood,

            and you are ruining it.





                      STAN

            No.   I'll get out.



They each get out.



========================================
====================10====================
EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS



Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the

POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.



                      ZOE

            Now what?



                      STAN

            I don't know. You tell me.



That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.



                      ZOE

            What? Where's he going?!

            (waving her hands, then)

            Come back!



They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Well, that was stupid. Why'd you

            get out, you, stupid-head?



                      STAN

            You said you were in a great mood

            and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

            (then)

            Did you just call me stupid-head?



Zoe storms off with her little steps.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================41====================
EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT



Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is

practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.



                      STAN

            My singing made you vomit.



                      ZOE

            No.    It's not that.



                      STAN

            Sure, we were a little out of tune,

            but...



                      ZOE

            I really don't feel well.



                      STAN

            Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?



ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.

Zoe's face pales.



                      CAROL

            Zoe?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...



                      CAROL

            Where have you been?    You haven't

            been coming to any--



                      ZOE

            (cutting her off)

            Right. I know. I've been so busy.

            Next one, I'm there. For sure.

            (then, awkward)

            This is my friend, Stan.





                      STAN

            Hi.



                      CAROL

            (eyeing Stan suspiciously)

            Hello. Are you two--



                      ZOE

            Late. Yes. We are. We really

            are.

            (pushing Stan along)

            I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.



They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.



                      STAN

            An old...boyfriend?



                      ZOE

            Her name is Carol. We're on

            a...committee together.



They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder

to make sure Carol's gone.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            All right. I have to go to bed

            now. I'll call you, okay?



                      STAN

            Okay.

            (then)

            Hey, I was thinking, if you don't

            have any plans this weekend, maybe

            you'd like to come up to the farm

            and get away for a few days.



                      ZOE

            I'll call you tomorrow.

            Something's not agreeing with me.



                      STAN

            Was it the lamb's tongue?



Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands

there for a beat. He calls after her.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Okay, well...this weekend.   Think

            about it.





========================================
====================82====================
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to

face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the

little bump, new since he's last been with her.



                      STAN

            Do you feel any kicking?



                      ZOE

            Sometimes.



                      STAN

            What does it feel like?



                      ZOE

            Like butterflies.





Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her

belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Are you really sure you want to do

            this?



                      STAN

            Yeah.     I'm really sure.



They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes

her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as

she dozes off.



========================================
====================106====================
EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY



14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to

unload their wares.



Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like

soldiers back from battle.



                      ZOE

            Wow. We really shouldn't have seen

            that.



                      STAN

            No.



                      ZOE

            I did mention that I barely know

            those people, right?



                      STAN

            Like forty times.



                      ZOE

            I feel the need to say it again.



They turn into the Farmer's Market.



ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little

Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.



                      STAN

            It won't be like that for us.



                      ZOE

            How do you know?



                      STAN

            Well, for starters, you wax.



ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese

stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on

Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Oh, hi.





                      STAN

            Hi.

            (awkward beat, then)

            You remember Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Right, hi.



And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            Wow.

            (then, to Stan)

            Wow.



At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It

says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.



                      ZOE

            What is that supposed to mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's nothing.



Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)

            I had no idea it was that serious.



                      STAN

            I told you it was serious.



                      ZOE

            (interrupting)

            What the hell does, "sorry about

            last night" mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's stupid. I was drunk and...



                      STAN

            It was nothing.



                      ZOE

            What was nothing?



Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.



                      OLIVIA

            You're having a baby? I didn't

            know you'd been together that long.





                      STAN

            Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,

            we're having a baby. Two actually.



On Zoe's look of shock we...



CUT TO:



========================================
====================107====================
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER



The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe

runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened.



                      ZOE

            Get away from me.



Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened!



                      ZOE

            You said, "they're not mine."



                      STAN

            I didn't mean to say it.



                      ZOE

            How could you say that?



                      STAN

            I don't know. I was flustered.



                      ZOE

            Flustered?



                      STAN

            I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking

            straight. I've been up all night

            watching Orca give birth!



                      ZOE

            (incredulous)

            "They're not mine?"



                      STAN

            (at a loss )

            Well, I mean...technically, they're

            not.





The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.

Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            You know, all this time you're

            trying to figure out who the real

            me is, but who the fuck are you?



                      STAN

            Zoe.



She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.



========================================
====================111====================
EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY



Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the

sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.



                      ZOE

            What.



                      STAN

            It's Thursday. We have a doctor's

            appointment.



                      ZOE

            There is no "we", Stan.



                      STAN

            Come on, I didn't mean to say it,

            and that's not how I feel.



Zoe shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            I made a mistake trusting you.



                      STAN

            Don't say that.     That's not true.



                      ZOE

            You're not good for me. You made

            me think I needed you, and I don't.





                      STAN

            So that's it? Because of one

            stupid, asinine thing that I said,

            it's all over? This is how it

            ends?



                      ZOE

            Yes.  This is how it ends.

            (then)

            I don't know why you're so

            surprised. I told you, nothing

            lasts forever.



Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.

INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY



They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.



                      ZOE

            Who knew you were such a romantic.





                      STAN

            Well, it's the anniversary of our

            first date. Where else would I

            take you?

            (then)

            Cheers.



They clink dogs and each take a bite.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            What a year, huh?



                      ZOE

            Incredible. Wouldn't change a

            thing. Well, except for the part

            where you dumped me.



                      STAN

            And the part where you dumped me.

            (to the babies)

            Girls...Mommy and Daddy were

            stupid.



The babies smile and coo.



                      ZOE

            (baby-talk)

            Yes, we were. Yes, we were.



                      STAN

            The first time we held hands was in

            here. It started out as a high-

            five, but then I strategically

            turned into a hand-hold.



                      ZOE

            How do you remember that?



                      STAN

            We both agreed that we were totally

            sick of weddings and hated when

            people wrote their own vows.



                      ZOE

            That's right. I remember that.



                      STAN

            So...I hope you won't hold it

            against me.



                      ZOE

            What?





Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at

them, confused.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What are you doing here?



And then Bobby comes through the door.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Bobby?



And then Mona.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's happening?



And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori

and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.

And we...



DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER



Zoe closes the door behind her.



                      ZOE

            Hallelujah!





As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices

someone entering the cab from the other side.



This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --

faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.



                      STAN

            You own it?



                      ZOE

            No, but I'm about to rent it.



                      STAN

            Actually, if we're being technical,

            you kind of stole it.



                      ZOE

            I don't think so.



                      STAN

            If you see someone about to get in

            a cab, you can't just run in from

            the other side and say it's yours.



                      ZOE

            I didn't see you.



                      STAN

            I saw you see me.



                      ZOE

            (to the cabbie)

            Sir, who saw you first?



The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.



                      STAN

            Maybe you're not from around here,

            but there's a code. It's like war,

            even though it's brutal and bloody,

            there are still certain rules we--



                      ZOE

            Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.



Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            But not because you're right, but

            because I am in a terrific mood,

            and you are ruining it.





                      STAN

            No.   I'll get out.



They each get out.



========================================
====================10====================
EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS



Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the

POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.



                      ZOE

            Now what?



                      STAN

            I don't know. You tell me.



That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.



                      ZOE

            What? Where's he going?!

            (waving her hands, then)

            Come back!



They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Well, that was stupid. Why'd you

            get out, you, stupid-head?



                      STAN

            You said you were in a great mood

            and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

            (then)

            Did you just call me stupid-head?



Zoe storms off with her little steps.



========================================
====================40====================
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT



Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.



                      ZOE

            Ohhhhhhhh.



She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that

must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the

answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her

eyes.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Please, God...



But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.





                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Water, water everywhere, but not a

            drop to...



She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's

done, she holds up the test.



CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in

vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Fuck me.



========================================
====================41====================
EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT



Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is

practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.



                      STAN

            My singing made you vomit.



                      ZOE

            No.    It's not that.



                      STAN

            Sure, we were a little out of tune,

            but...



                      ZOE

            I really don't feel well.



                      STAN

            Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?



ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.

Zoe's face pales.



                      CAROL

            Zoe?



                      ZOE

            Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...



                      CAROL

            Where have you been?    You haven't

            been coming to any--



                      ZOE

            (cutting her off)

            Right. I know. I've been so busy.

            Next one, I'm there. For sure.

            (then, awkward)

            This is my friend, Stan.





                      STAN

            Hi.



                      CAROL

            (eyeing Stan suspiciously)

            Hello. Are you two--



                      ZOE

            Late. Yes. We are. We really

            are.

            (pushing Stan along)

            I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.



They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.



                      STAN

            An old...boyfriend?



                      ZOE

            Her name is Carol. We're on

            a...committee together.



They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder

to make sure Carol's gone.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            All right. I have to go to bed

            now. I'll call you, okay?



                      STAN

            Okay.

            (then)

            Hey, I was thinking, if you don't

            have any plans this weekend, maybe

            you'd like to come up to the farm

            and get away for a few days.



                      ZOE

            I'll call you tomorrow.

            Something's not agreeing with me.



                      STAN

            Was it the lamb's tongue?



Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands

there for a beat. He calls after her.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            Okay, well...this weekend.   Think

            about it.





========================================
====================82====================
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to

face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the

little bump, new since he's last been with her.



                      STAN

            Do you feel any kicking?



                      ZOE

            Sometimes.



                      STAN

            What does it feel like?



                      ZOE

            Like butterflies.





Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her

belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Are you really sure you want to do

            this?



                      STAN

            Yeah.     I'm really sure.



They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes

her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as

she dozes off.



========================================
====================106====================
EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY



14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to

unload their wares.



Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like

soldiers back from battle.



                      ZOE

            Wow. We really shouldn't have seen

            that.



                      STAN

            No.



                      ZOE

            I did mention that I barely know

            those people, right?



                      STAN

            Like forty times.



                      ZOE

            I feel the need to say it again.



They turn into the Farmer's Market.



ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little

Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.



                      STAN

            It won't be like that for us.



                      ZOE

            How do you know?



                      STAN

            Well, for starters, you wax.



ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese

stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on

Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Oh, hi.





                      STAN

            Hi.

            (awkward beat, then)

            You remember Zoe.



                      OLIVIA

            Right, hi.



And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            Wow.

            (then, to Stan)

            Wow.



At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It

says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.



                      ZOE

            What is that supposed to mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's nothing.



Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.



                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

            (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)

            I had no idea it was that serious.



                      STAN

            I told you it was serious.



                      ZOE

            (interrupting)

            What the hell does, "sorry about

            last night" mean?



                      OLIVIA

            It's stupid. I was drunk and...



                      STAN

            It was nothing.



                      ZOE

            What was nothing?



Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.



                      OLIVIA

            You're having a baby? I didn't

            know you'd been together that long.





                      STAN

            Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,

            we're having a baby. Two actually.



On Zoe's look of shock we...



CUT TO:

EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER



The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe

runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened.



                      ZOE

            Get away from me.



Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.



                      STAN

            Nothing happened!



                      ZOE

            You said, "they're not mine."



                      STAN

            I didn't mean to say it.



                      ZOE

            How could you say that?



                      STAN

            I don't know. I was flustered.



                      ZOE

            Flustered?



                      STAN

            I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking

            straight. I've been up all night

            watching Orca give birth!



                      ZOE

            (incredulous)

            "They're not mine?"



                      STAN

            (at a loss )

            Well, I mean...technically, they're

            not.





The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.

Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            You know, all this time you're

            trying to figure out who the real

            me is, but who the fuck are you?



                      STAN

            Zoe.



She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.



========================================
====================111====================
EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY



Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the

sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.



                      ZOE

            What.



                      STAN

            It's Thursday. We have a doctor's

            appointment.



                      ZOE

            There is no "we", Stan.



                      STAN

            Come on, I didn't mean to say it,

            and that's not how I feel.



Zoe shakes her head.



                      ZOE

            I made a mistake trusting you.



                      STAN

            Don't say that.     That's not true.



                      ZOE

            You're not good for me. You made

            me think I needed you, and I don't.





                      STAN

            So that's it? Because of one

            stupid, asinine thing that I said,

            it's all over? This is how it

            ends?



                      ZOE

            Yes.  This is how it ends.

            (then)

            I don't know why you're so

            surprised. I told you, nothing

            lasts forever.



Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.

INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY



They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.



                      ZOE

            Who knew you were such a romantic.





                      STAN

            Well, it's the anniversary of our

            first date. Where else would I

            take you?

            (then)

            Cheers.



They clink dogs and each take a bite.



                      STAN (CONT'D)

            What a year, huh?



                      ZOE

            Incredible. Wouldn't change a

            thing. Well, except for the part

            where you dumped me.



                      STAN

            And the part where you dumped me.

            (to the babies)

            Girls...Mommy and Daddy were

            stupid.



The babies smile and coo.



                      ZOE

            (baby-talk)

            Yes, we were. Yes, we were.



                      STAN

            The first time we held hands was in

            here. It started out as a high-

            five, but then I strategically

            turned into a hand-hold.



                      ZOE

            How do you remember that?



                      STAN

            We both agreed that we were totally

            sick of weddings and hated when

            people wrote their own vows.



                      ZOE

            That's right. I remember that.



                      STAN

            So...I hope you won't hold it

            against me.



                      ZOE

            What?





Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at

them, confused.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What are you doing here?



And then Bobby comes through the door.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            Bobby?



And then Mona.



                      ZOE (CONT'D)

            What's happening?



And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori

and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.

And we...
