     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     

     Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.

     

     She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for

     a night table.

     

     She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the

     phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."

     

     She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of

     water.  It's 12:26.

     

     She gets in bed, her side, the left side.

     

     She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from

     her.

     

     We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the

     number one dissolves away, changing the time to --

     

     DISSOLVE TO:

     

========================================
====================18====================
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     

     -- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the

     door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and

     down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,

     still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping

     even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the

     ground floor.

     

     We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the

     canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on

     the street.

     

     We move right up against the window, peer through the glass

     just as --

     

     -- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see

     through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the

     driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark

     clothes.

     

     The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across

     the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.

     

     He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.

     We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.

     

     But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in

     again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.

     

     The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,

     which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.

     Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.

     

     He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,

     onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't

     tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for

     something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.

     

     The fire escape.

     

     The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of

     vision.

     

     We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We

     start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in

     the kitchen, toward the stairwell.

     

========================================
====================20====================
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     

     In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:

     

     ZONE 19 DISABLED

     

========================================
====================56====================
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     

     The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate

     RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off

     down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.

     

     Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.

     

========================================
====================58====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the

     doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door

     wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at

     the red button on the wall --

     

     -- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --

     

     -- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive

     coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the

     steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --

     

     -- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.

     

========================================
====================135====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's

     face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent

     anger of her own.

     

     But she doesn't open the door.

     

========================================
====================148====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and

     the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.

     Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.

     

                          RAOUL

               You're wasting your fucking time,

               man, you're wasting my time.  You

               don't know how to do this, and the

               longer we stay in here, the more

               likely she's gonna lose it and call

               the cops!

     

                          BURNHAM

               Are you gonna open the safe?

     

     Raoul looks at him.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Then shut up and get out of my way.

     

     As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with

     Sarah, who is staring at him.

     

                          RAOUL

               Don't look at me.

     

     ACROSS THE ROOM,

     

     Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the

     pouch.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Okay, kid, all I know about this is

               what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk

               me through it.

     

     Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham

     swallows.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV

               don't lie, right?

     

     He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,

     and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,

     stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.

     

                          BURNHAM

               You seem like a good kid.  Your

               mom... only saw her for a second,

               but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?

     

     No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's

     arm, pulls it tight.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Hey, nod or something, show me

               you're still alive, will ya?

     

     Sarah nods.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Attagirl.  That too tight?

     

     Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts

     to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.

     

                          BURNHAM

               You guys are pretty rich, huh?

     

     Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of

     finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he

     goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:

     

                          BURNHAM

               Yeah, you don't think about that

               stuff.  Good for you.

     

     He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about

     him.

     

                          BURNHAM

               I know, I know.  I really screwed

               the pooch this time.  I never did

               anything like this before.  Break

               into somebody's house?  Not even

               close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to

               God, I been on the wrong end of

               maybe six straight years of bad

               cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.

               (snaps his fingers --

               gone)

               Those are some seriously bad cards.

               And still, every time I pick up a

               fresh hand I swear to God, the rush

               comes so hot and prickly I feel it

               right down to my toes because this

               time, this one time, it might be

               there, this time it might be that

               hand, that perfect hand, that

               monster hand.

               (shakes his head)

               And you thought you were sick.

     

     The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back

     down.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Feel better?

     

     Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her

     to sit up, to lean against the wall.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Woulda been a hell of a dad.

     

     CUT TO:

     

========================================
====================159====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors

     carefully.

     

     ON THE MONITORS,

     

     we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living

     room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.

     

     IN THE PANIC ROOM,

     

     Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?

     

========================================
====================160====================
     INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT

     

     Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.

     She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.

     

     The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.

     

     She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is

     empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the

     house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's

     front stoop.

     

     She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up

     onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.

     

     We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops

     down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --

     

     -- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.

     

     ON THE MONITORS,

     

     we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly

     standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was

     specifically told not to go.

     

     IN THE PANIC ROOM,

     

     Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to

     be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to

     turn around, to look at the monitors again --

     

     -- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.

     

                          RAOUL

               Hey!

     

     He turns, away from the monitors.

     

                          SARAH

               Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.

     

     Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --

     

     ON THE MONITORS,

     

     Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on

     the monitor.

     

     IN THE PANIC ROOM,

     

     Sarah sees her mother go.

     

                          SARAH

               (to Raoul)

               Won't happen again.
