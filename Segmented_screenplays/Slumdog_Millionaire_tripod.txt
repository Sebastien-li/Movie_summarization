     INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                



     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes

     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,

     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,

     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap

     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the

     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.



                                     SALIM

                    Go away. Ja, ja!



     The girl might not even have heard.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    She'll have the Security Guard

                    onto us, standing there.



                                     JAMAL

                    Not if we let her in.



                                     SALIM

                    No.



                                     JAMAL

                    She could be the third

                    musketeer.



                                     SALIM

                    I am the head of this family,

                    now. And I say no. Piss off,

                    you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    We don't even know what the

                    third musketeer's called.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                



                                     SALIM

                    Hey.



     Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

     swaying with alcohol.



                                     JAMAL

                    Salim?



     He puts his hand out to Latika.



                                     SALIM

                    Come.



                                     JAMAL

                    No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

                    lot to drink...



     Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

     throat and pushes him down on the bed.







                                     SALIM

                    I am the elder. And I am the

                    boss. For once, you do as I say.



                                     JAMAL

                    No.



     Salim pulls Latika to her feet.



                                     SALIM

                    I saved your bloody life, didn't

                    I?



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, please-



                                     SALIM

                    - chup, sali.



     As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

     on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

     course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

     herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

     delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

     door, laughing.

====================139====================
     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

                    Fifteen seconds.



     Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.



                                     PREM

                    Do the right thing and in

                    approximately three minutes you

                    will be as famous as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Ten seconds.







                                     PREM

                    And as rich as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Five seconds.



                                     PREM

                    Almost.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                                     PREM

                    From rags to Raja. It's your

                    destiny.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...we're on.



     Applause from the audience.



                                     PREM

                    Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

                    A Millionaire? In the chair

                    tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

                    don't know! In an amazing run,

                    Jamal has already five million

                    rupees but, not content with

                    that, has chosen to gamble for

                    one Crore- that's ten million

                    million rupees. What a player!

                    The question one more time:

                    Which cricketer has scored the

                    most first class centuries in

                    history. Was it A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

                    Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.



                                     JAMAL

                    I know it isn't Sachin

                    Tendulkar.



                                     PREM

                    That's a start. So, it could be

                    Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

                    Michael Slater.



                                     JAMAL

                    I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

                    fifty.



                                     PREM

                    Okay. Computer, take away two

                    wrong answers.



     Music swells, lights dim.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Well, you were right about

                    Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

                    has taken away A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                    That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                    choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                    or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                    think? Decision time. For half a

                    million rupees. Your answer: B)

                    Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.



     A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

     Prem's eyes.



                                     JAMAL

                    D.



     A barely perceptible jump from Prem.



                                     PREM

                    You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

                    The Australian? Great cricketer.



                                     JAMAL

                    D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Do you know?



     Jamal shakes his head.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?



                                     JAMAL

                    Or D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Final Answer?



                                     JAMAL

                    Final Answer. D.



     A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.



     Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    With one hundred and ninety-

                    seven first class centuries, the

                    answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!



     The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Jamal Malik, Crorepati!



     The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

     disgusted spit. Then he is back on.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    I cannot believe what I am

                    seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen....So, are you ready

                    for the final question for two

                    Crore rupees- twenty million

                    rupees?



                                     JAMAL

                    Not really, but...maybe it is

                    written, no?



                                     PREM

                    Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

                    twenty million rupees, the final

                    question on Who Wants to be a

                    Millionaire?



     The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

     Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

     nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

                    would need a pacemaker fitted,

                    we're out of time! What a show,

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

                    show. Join us tomorrow night to

                    see if Jamal Malik has made the

                    biggest mistake of his life or

                    has just won the biggest prize

                    in the history of Indian

                    television....Same place, same

                    time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                    Goodnight!



     Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

     his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

     and pulls out his mobile.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.



                                     INSPECTOR

                    That's why he's on the show.



     He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.

     The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

     the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

     an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

     on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

     faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.
