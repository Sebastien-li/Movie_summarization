          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM

                         

          And finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     You just come in and out whenever

                     you want?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I thought we should talk...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     (laughs, then in a rage)

                     One damn night in a month I told

                     you was important to me, et tu es

                     meme pas capable d'etre la...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...I was working, do you

                     understand? I'm under enormous

                     pressure, I have obligations...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...I don't want to hear about your

                     obligations. If you cared -- YOU

                     WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I was there! I was there! I was

                     late, but I was there. And I'm

                     here now.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     No, no, no. You're here when it's

                     convenient for you to be here.

                     C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

                     YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!



                         

          She walks off into the

                         

                         LIVING ROOM

                         

          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

          downs a red wine.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Why did you buy those paintings?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because I liked them.

                         

          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

          her anger.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Okay, thank you for helping me get

                     started. But if I'm gonna fail--

                     then let me fail!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

                     would you fail?

                         

          He crosses towards her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

                     wants to throw money away but if

                     you wanna start a business, you

                     have to project a certain image.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     What image?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Success.

                         

          He sits down next to her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     The market's a disaster right now;

                     nobody's moving anything. That's

                     why you gotta show sales. People

                     look at you then and they say

                     "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

                     that's what they remember. Always.

                         

          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...



                         

                                 JULIE

                     (QUIETLY)

                     You're never gonna leave her.

                         

          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

                         

                                 CUT TO:

                         

                         BEDROOM

                         

          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

                         

          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Come away with me. Let's just take

                     your car and go...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...Where?...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     There's a place upstate. Very

                     beautiful, on the water. We can

                     wake up there together- just you

                     and me. I'd like that.

                         

          She's keeps crying, but...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Me, too.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT

                         

          A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards

          Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More

          Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie

          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

                         

          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

                         

          A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to

          Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where

          the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,

          flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

                         

                                 SYD

                     He's gonna walk.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're certain?

                     Courts aren't for certainty, but he

                     says he was at home, why shouldn't

                     he be? A phone call doesn't make

                     him a liar.

                     (off Robert's nod)

                     But what's baffling to me, though,

                     despite your sentimental history

                     together, is why you would put your

                                 SYD

                     She met with Gil Deuchman.

                                 SYD

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not to me.

                         

          They sit in silence.

                     Who called you?

                         

          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     It was a wrong number.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

                     half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

                     the case that you know exactly who

                     called you and exactly why? Why are

                     you lying to this court?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I'm not lying.

                         

          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm going to introduce into evidence

                     People's A. This is a toll booth

                     photograph taken in the northbound ninth

                     lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to the

                     photograph, would you please read the

                     date and time stamp indicated on the

                     lower right hand corner?

                         

          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is crazy.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (whispers in Jimmy's ear)

                     You're gonna have to answer that.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, please answer the question.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     April 11th, two thirty-three am.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, directing your attention

                     to the same photograph, would you

                     please read the license plate

                     number of the vehicle passing

                     through the toll?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     D D G five five four two.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     (handing in another sheet)

                     This is People's B, a printout from

                     the Department of Motor Vehicles

                     plate registry... Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to that

                     printout, are those numbers on the

                     toll photograph the same ones that

                     are on your own license plate?

                         

          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

                     Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Yes, the numbers are the same?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     How do you explain that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I can't.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     But that is your car in this

                     photograph, isn't it?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     No, that is not your car?

                     (off his silence)

                     Answer the question, Mr. Grant.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is not my car in this picture.

                     I don't know how you all did that,

                     but this is not my car.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You expect this grand jury to

                     believe that that is not your car

                     when there is a printout from the

                     department of motor vehicles...

                         

                                 EARL

                     That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

                     not permitted to go on record.

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

                     a lot of people.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     And this piece of paper makes

                     everything okay?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, it makes it easier.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (BEAT)

                     You worried I'm gonna say something?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No.

                         

          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Robert, look: you asked me to come

                     meet you and I'm here, but I came

                     because I wanted to get something

                     straight between us: we're even.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, we're even. But just for the

                     record though, what you did...

                     (picks up the trust document)

                     Was way beyond the money.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (LAUGHS)

                     Nothing's beyond money for you.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS BACK)

                     Thanks a lot.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (pointing to the document)

                     And if I take this, then what does

                     that say about me?

                         

          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

          his pocket.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

                     and do something good with it.

                         

          Hold on Jimmy.
