          INT. POOL ROOM

                         

          Where we see Brooke and Peter seated with a group of

          EXECUTIVES including AIMES (45), and BARNES (43).

                         

          Displeasure immediately registers on Robert's face.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (sotto, to Gavin)

                     Where the hell is Mayfield?

                         

          Gavin shakes his head. They approach the table.

                         

                                 BARNES

                     (as they sit)

                     Mr. Miller, thank you for coming.

                     We were just getting acquainted

                     with Brooke and Peter here.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILING)

                     I hope they didn't beat you up

                     too much.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     They've been terrific.

                         

                                 PETER

                     Dad, we've been talking about operations.

                     Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save

                     about fifty percent on our back-office.

                         

          Robert phone VIBRATES. It's "Julie" calling. He silences it.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'd love to hear about that, but...

                     (A BEAT)

                     I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to

                     join us tonight.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     (NODS)

                     Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he

                     suggested we get right into details.

                         

                                 BARNES

                     I was just telling Brooke: now that

                     we can market your quants' track

                     records, we have access to a host of

                     new capital that...

                         

          Robert drifts as the suits prattle on.

                         

                                 DISSOLVE TO:

          Robert cleans himself up in the sink, applying soap and water

          to his cut stomach, scrubbing frantically, He takes all the

          paper towels and puts them in his pocket.

          EXT. ELLEN'S OFFICE

                         

          Ellen exits the building, passes the doorman and then Bryer,

          who is waiting in his car outside the multi-unit townhouse

          where she keeps her office.

                         

          She doesn't notice him as she passes and enters a TOWNCAR.

          She's about half-way into the car when he approaches.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (calling after her)

                     Mrs. Miller?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (STARTLED)

                     Yes?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (shows his badge)

                     Detective Bryer.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Did you just call my office?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well, I don't have time right now,

                     sorry..

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (turning on the charm)

                     Just take a couple a seconds. It's

                     about your husband.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well, fine, but, make an appointment.

                         

          She closes the door and rides away. Bryer smiles in

          frustration, walks back to his car.

          Robert enters, moving much slower. As he approaches Cindy, he

          sees a worried look on her face.

                         

                                 CINDY

                     Brooke's waiting for you...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did we have a meeting?

                         

                                 CINDY

                     No, but she looked upset.

          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK

                         

          Jimmy approaches the building. Bryer exits his sedan and

          walks over to him.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (SEEING BRYER)

                     Oh, man, what?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Jimmy, take a ride with me.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Where? Back to the station?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     No man, just get in the car.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if I say no?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm not threatening you. I'm just

                     asking you -- take a ride with me.

                         

          Jimmy considers, gets into Bryer's car.

          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

                         

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

                         

                                 SYD

                     He's gonna walk.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're certain?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Courts aren't for certainty, but he

                     says he was at home, why shouldn't

                     he be? A phone call doesn't make

                     him a liar.

                     (off Robert's nod)

                     But what's baffling to me, though,

                     despite your sentimental history

                     together, is why you would put your

                     family's future in this kid's hands.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (BEAT)

                     He's not like us.

                         

                                 SYD

                     Is that a good thing?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (laughs, plays with his

                     SCOTCH GLASS)

                     I don't know.

                         

          Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

                         

                                 SYD

                     How's Ellen?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She's good. Fine.

                     (stops packing, looks up)

                     Why?

                         

                                 SYD

                     I heard something...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes...?

                         

                                 SYD

                     She met with Gil Deuchman.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The estate lawyer?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not to me.

                         

          They sit in silence.

          INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY

                         

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (WHISPERS)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

                     No, no no, you should have-- I want

          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests

                     Yeah, well... I just... wanted it

                     to be about the family tonight.

                         

          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

          down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.

                     Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.

                         

          She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.

                         

                                 ELLEN

          He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.

          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.

                         

          After a second, the door BUZZES open.

          He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still

          rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP

          BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.

                         

          He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger

          side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to

          touch her, then stops.

                         

          Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in

          his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.

                         

          Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and

          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.

          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.

                         

                                 BRYER

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Who authorized this?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I did.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (after a beat)

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

          Ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds

          down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.

                     Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.

                         

          She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.

                         

                                 ELLEN

          He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.

          Hold on her.

          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.

                         

          After a second, the door BUZZES open.

          He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still

          rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP

          BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.

                         

          He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger

          side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to

          touch her, then stops.

                         

          Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in

          his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.

                         

          Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (WHISPERS)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and

          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.

          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.

                         

                                 BRYER

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Who authorized this?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I did.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (after a beat)

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests

          with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (LAUGHS)

                     It's all about you, isn't it.

                     Four... and nineteen.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, yeah yeah...

                         

          Brooke nods, tries to smile.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     So what was that all about?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     Yeah, well... I just... wanted it

                     to be about the family tonight.

                         

          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     You see this?

                         

          He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story:

                         

          "Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits

          in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis."

                     Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel

                     about that. Trash can.

                     Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?

                         

          Brooke leans back and stares at him.

                     there's some other things I'd like to

                     do. Maybe I would like to spend a

                     outside the office.

                         

          Brooke shoots him a look.

                     What?

                         

          Staring at him, then

          Ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds

          down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Where are you going?

                     Now?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.

                         

          She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (SMILES)

                     But, I haven't given you your

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILING BACK)

                     I'll be back as soon as I can.

                         

          He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.

          Hold on her.

          Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie

          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.

                         

          After a second, the door BUZZES open.

          Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress:

          trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...

                         

========================================

          EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

                         

          He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still

          rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP

          BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.

                         

          He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger

          side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to

          touch her, then stops.

                         

          Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in

          his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.

                         

          Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.

          About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting.

          Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.

          INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY

                         

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (WHISPERS)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          Mills waits on a nearby bench, watching as Bryer exits the

          chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and

          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.

          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (on the phone)

                     Well when do you expect her...? When

                     do you expect her? Okay, well so I

          INT. MAYFIELD'S LIMO - NIGHT

                         

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Who authorized this?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I did.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (after a beat)

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

                                 ROBERT

                     No, no no, you should have-- I want

                     more "you's" around.

                         

          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests

          with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.

                     Yeah, well... I just... wanted it

                     to be about the family tonight.

                         

          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                     This shouldn't have happened.

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

          AIMES, sits nearby.

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          spreading realization.

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

                     Yeah, well... I just... wanted it

                     to be about the family tonight.

                         

          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                     (after a beat)

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

                     to be about the family tonight.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                     This shouldn't have happened.

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

                     Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel

                     about that. Trash can.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Peter's got a copy pinned up in the

                     conference room.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (sits back, takes a drink)

                     Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?

                         

          Brooke leans back and stares at him.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Why sell our company? We make a

                     great return, we give money to the

                     causes we believe in...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     My darling, you are still in your 20's.

                     I am 60. That's a big difference in

                     point of view.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Dad, you're not that old.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     It catches up alright. And maybe

                     there's some other things I'd like to

                     do. Maybe I would like to spend a

                     little more time with you guys...

                     outside the office.

                         

          Brooke shoots him a look.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (GROWING IMPATIENT)

                     What?

                         

          Staring at him, then

                                 JIMMY

                     (through the window)

                     Call me, alright, and let me know

                     it's okay.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (as he exits)

                     Better we don't talk for a while.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (can't believe it--

                     through the window)

                     So what you get in a bind and just

                     call up the only nigger you know?



                         

          Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just

                     go home.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.

                         

          Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.

          various charity events.

                         

          MAE (30s) sits at a reception desk typing. The phone RINGS.

          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

                         

          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

          him quietly, then quickly looks away.

                         

          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

          holds a moment at the casket.

                         

          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

                         

                                 ASSISTANT

                     Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

                     you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

                         

          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

          approaches as she stands.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I am so, so sorry.

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     (nods, then)

                     I just wanted to thank you for what

                     you did for my daughter.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (shaking his head softly)

                     No...

                         

                                 SANDRINE

                     You believed in her, and you gave

                     her a chance. She was happy. I know

                     she was happy.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's just...

                     (EMOTIONAL)

                     not fair, is it?

                         

          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (WHISPERS)

                     This shouldn't have happened.

                         

          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.

          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.

          INT. MAYFIELD'S LIMO - NIGHT

                         

          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

          AIMES, sits nearby.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     There's just one more thing... And

                     I hate to mention it now, but I

                     just received it...

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Speak, John.

                         

          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I had Stern Marling run a secondary

                     audit on the Miller financials.

                         

          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

                         

          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

          Million..."

                         

          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

          spreading realization.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     Who authorized this?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     I did.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (after a beat)

                     And what did you conclude?

                         

                                 AIMES

                     It's in front of you.

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I didn't ask you what the paper said,

                     John. I asked you what you thought.



                         

                                 AIMES

                     (after a beat, carefully)

                     Well... what do you think?

                         

                                 MAYFIELD

                     I think... I think... that I don't

                     see anything wrong here.

                         

          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

          papers. Aimes nods.

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                     Miller's personal assistant, right

                     this way.

                         

========================================
====================58====================
          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                                 JULIE

                     You just come in and out whenever

                     you want?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I thought we should talk...

                     you was important to me, et tu es

                     ...I was working, do you

                     understand? I'm under enormous

                     pressure, I have obligations...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...I don't want to hear about your

                     obligations. If you cared -- YOU

                     WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I was there! I was there! I was

                     late, but I was there. And I'm

                     here now.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     No, no, no. You're here when it's

                     convenient for you to be here.

                     C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

                     YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!



                         

          She walks off into the

                         

                         LIVING ROOM

                         

          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

          downs a red wine.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Why did you buy those paintings?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because I liked them.

                         

          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

          her anger.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Okay, thank you for helping me get

                     started. But if I'm gonna fail--

                     then let me fail!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

                     would you fail?

                         

          He crosses towards her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

                     wants to throw money away but if

                     you wanna start a business, you

                     have to project a certain image.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     What image?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Success.

                         

          He sits down next to her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     The market's a disaster right now;

                     nobody's moving anything. That's

                     why you gotta show sales. People

                     look at you then and they say

                     "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

                     that's what they remember. Always.

                         

          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...



                         

                                 JULIE

                     (QUIETLY)

                     You're never gonna leave her.

                         

          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

                         

                                 CUT TO:

                         

                         BEDROOM

                         

          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

                         

          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Come away with me. Let's just take

                     your car and go...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...Where?...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     There's a place upstate. Very

                     beautiful, on the water. We can

                     wake up there together- just you

                     and me. I'd like that.

                         

          She's keeps crying, but...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Me, too.

          A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards

          Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More

          Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie

          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

                         

          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

                         

          A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to

          Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where

          the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,

          flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

                         

                                 SYD

                     He's gonna walk.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're certain?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Courts aren't for certainty, but he

                     says he was at home, why shouldn't

                     he be? A phone call doesn't make

                     him a liar.

                     (off Robert's nod)

                     But what's baffling to me, though,

                     despite your sentimental history

                     together, is why you would put your

                     family's future in this kid's hands.

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not to me.

          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The

          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next

          to Jimmy.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That was the early morning of April 11th.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You received a phone call?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Who called you?

                         

          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     It was a wrong number.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

                     half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

                     the case that you know exactly who

                     called you and exactly why? Why are

                     you lying to this court?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I'm not lying.

                         

          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm going to introduce into evidence

                     People's A. This is a toll booth

                     photograph taken in the northbound ninth

                     lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to the

                     photograph, would you please read the

                     date and time stamp indicated on the

                     lower right hand corner?

                         

          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is crazy.

                     You're gonna have to answer that.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, please answer the question.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, directing your attention

                     to the same photograph, would you

                     please read the license plate

                     number of the vehicle passing

                     through the toll?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     D D G five five four two.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     (handing in another sheet)

                     This is People's B, a printout from

                     the Department of Motor Vehicles

                     plate registry... Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to that

                     printout, are those numbers on the

                     toll photograph the same ones that

                     are on your own license plate?

                         

          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

                     Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Yes, the numbers are the same?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     How do you explain that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I can't.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     But that is your car in this

                     photograph, isn't it?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     No, that is not your car?

                     (off his silence)

                     Answer the question, Mr. Grant.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is not my car in this picture.

                     I don't know how you all did that,

                     but this is not my car.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You expect this grand jury to

                     believe that that is not your car

                     when there is a printout from the

                     department of motor vehicles...

                         

                                 EARL

                     That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

                     not permitted to go on record.

          EXT. OUTDOOR COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

                         

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

                     a lot of people.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     And this piece of paper makes

                     everything okay?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, it makes it easier.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (BEAT)

                     You worried I'm gonna say something?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No.

                         

          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Robert, look: you asked me to come

                     meet you and I'm here, but I came

                     because I wanted to get something

                     straight between us: we're even.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, we're even. But just for the

                     record though, what you did...

                     (picks up the trust document)

                     Was way beyond the money.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (LAUGHS)

                     Nothing's beyond money for you.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS BACK)

                     Thanks a lot.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (pointing to the document)

                     And if I take this, then what does

                     that say about me?

                         

          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

          his pocket.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

                     and do something good with it.

                         

          Hold on Jimmy.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

                         

          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to

          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:

          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."

                         

========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.



                         

========================================
====================89====================
          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.

          And finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     You just come in and out whenever

                     you want?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I thought we should talk...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     (laughs, then in a rage)

                     One damn night in a month I told

                     you was important to me, et tu es

                     meme pas capable d'etre la...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...I was working, do you

                     understand? I'm under enormous

                     pressure, I have obligations...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...I don't want to hear about your

                     obligations. If you cared -- YOU

                     WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I was there! I was there! I was

                     late, but I was there. And I'm

                     here now.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     No, no, no. You're here when it's

                     convenient for you to be here.

                     C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

                     YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!



                         

          She walks off into the

                         

                         LIVING ROOM

                         

          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

          downs a red wine.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Why did you buy those paintings?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because I liked them.

                         

          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

          her anger.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Okay, thank you for helping me get

                     started. But if I'm gonna fail--

                     then let me fail!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

                     would you fail?

                         

          He crosses towards her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

                     wants to throw money away but if

                     you wanna start a business, you

                     have to project a certain image.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     What image?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Success.

                         

          He sits down next to her.

                     The market's a disaster right now;

                     nobody's moving anything. That's

                     why you gotta show sales. People

                     look at you then and they say

                     "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

                     that's what they remember. Always.

                         

          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...



                         

                                 JULIE

                     (QUIETLY)

                     You're never gonna leave her.

                         

          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

                         

                                 CUT TO:

                         

                         BEDROOM

                         

          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

                         

          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Come away with me. Let's just take

                     your car and go...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...Where?...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     There's a place upstate. Very

                     beautiful, on the water. We can

                     wake up there together- just you

                     and me. I'd like that.

                         

          She's keeps crying, but...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Me, too.

          A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards

          Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More

          Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie

          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

                         

          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

                         

          A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to

          Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where

          the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,

          flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

                         

                                 SYD

                     He's gonna walk.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're certain?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Courts aren't for certainty, but he

                     says he was at home, why shouldn't

                     he be? A phone call doesn't make

                     him a liar.

                     (off Robert's nod)

                     But what's baffling to me, though,

                     despite your sentimental history

                     together, is why you would put your

                     family's future in this kid's hands.

                                 SYD

                     Is that a good thing?

                     I don't know.

                         

          Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

                     She met with Gil Deuchman.

                                 SYD

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not to me.

                         

          They sit in silence.

          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The

          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next

          to Jimmy.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That was the early morning of April 11th.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You received a phone call?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Who called you?

                         

          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     It was a wrong number.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

                     half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

                     the case that you know exactly who

                     called you and exactly why? Why are

                     you lying to this court?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I'm not lying.

                         

          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm going to introduce into evidence

                     People's A. This is a toll booth

                     photograph taken in the northbound ninth

                     lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to the

                     photograph, would you please read the

                     date and time stamp indicated on the

                     lower right hand corner?

                         

          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is crazy.

                     You're gonna have to answer that.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, please answer the question.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, directing your attention

                     to the same photograph, would you

                     please read the license plate

                     number of the vehicle passing

                     through the toll?

                     (handing in another sheet)

                     This is People's B, a printout from

                     the Department of Motor Vehicles

                     directing your attention to that

                     printout, are those numbers on the

                     toll photograph the same ones that

                     are on your own license plate?

                         

          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Yes, the numbers are the same?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     How do you explain that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I can't.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     But that is your car in this

                     photograph, isn't it?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     No, that is not your car?

                     (off his silence)

                     Answer the question, Mr. Grant.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is not my car in this picture.

                     I don't know how you all did that,

                     but this is not my car.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You expect this grand jury to

                     believe that that is not your car

                     when there is a printout from the

                     department of motor vehicles...

                         

                                 EARL

                     That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

                     not permitted to go on record.

          EXT. OUTDOOR COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

                         

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

                     a lot of people.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     And this piece of paper makes

                     everything okay?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, it makes it easier.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (BEAT)

                     You worried I'm gonna say something?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No.

                         

          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Robert, look: you asked me to come

                     meet you and I'm here, but I came

                     because I wanted to get something

                     straight between us: we're even.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, we're even. But just for the

                     record though, what you did...

                     (picks up the trust document)

                     Was way beyond the money.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (LAUGHS)

                     Nothing's beyond money for you.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS BACK)

                     Thanks a lot.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (pointing to the document)

                     And if I take this, then what does

                     that say about me?

                         

          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

          his pocket.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

                     and do something good with it.

                         

          Hold on Jimmy.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

                         

          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to

          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:

          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."

                         

========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                     Yes, your honor.

                         

========================================
====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                                 JULIE

                     You just come in and out whenever

                     you want?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I thought we should talk...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     (laughs, then in a rage)

                     One damn night in a month I told

                     you was important to me, et tu es

                     meme pas capable d'etre la...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...I was working, do you

                     understand? I'm under enormous

                     pressure, I have obligations...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...I don't want to hear about your

                     obligations. If you cared -- YOU

                     WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I was there! I was there! I was

                     late, but I was there. And I'm

                     here now.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     No, no, no. You're here when it's

                     convenient for you to be here.

                     C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

                     YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!



                         

          She walks off into the

          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

          downs a red wine.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Why did you buy those paintings?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because I liked them.

                         

          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

          her anger.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Okay, thank you for helping me get

                     started. But if I'm gonna fail--

                     then let me fail!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

                     would you fail?

                         

          He crosses towards her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

                     wants to throw money away but if

                     you wanna start a business, you

                     have to project a certain image.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     What image?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Success.

                         

          He sits down next to her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     The market's a disaster right now;

                     nobody's moving anything. That's

                     why you gotta show sales. People

                     look at you then and they say

                     "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

                     that's what they remember. Always.

                         

          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...



                         

                                 JULIE

                     You're never gonna leave her.

                         

          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

                         

          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Come away with me. Let's just take

                     your car and go...

                         

                                 JULIE

                                 ROBERT

                     There's a place upstate. Very

                     beautiful, on the water. We can

                     wake up there together- just you

                     and me. I'd like that.

                         

          She's keeps crying, but...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Me, too.

          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

                         

          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

          He doesn't look familiar. Off Brooke, curious.

                     NYPD Homicide, would you mind

                     stepping into the car?

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

                         

                                 SYD

                     He's gonna walk.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're certain?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Courts aren't for certainty, but he

                     says he was at home, why shouldn't

                     he be? A phone call doesn't make

                     him a liar.

                     (off Robert's nod)

                     But what's baffling to me, though,

                     despite your sentimental history

                     together, is why you would put your

                     family's future in this kid's hands.

                     I don't know.

                         

          Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                     Not to me.

          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The

          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next

          to Jimmy.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That was the early morning of April 11th.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You received a phone call?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Who called you?

                         

          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     It was a wrong number.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

                     half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

                     the case that you know exactly who

                     called you and exactly why? Why are

                     you lying to this court?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I'm not lying.

                         

          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm going to introduce into evidence

                     People's A. This is a toll booth

                     photograph taken in the northbound ninth

                     lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to the

                     photograph, would you please read the

                     date and time stamp indicated on the

                     lower right hand corner?

                         

          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is crazy.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (whispers in Jimmy's ear)

                     You're gonna have to answer that.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, please answer the question.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, directing your attention

                     to the same photograph, would you

                     please read the license plate

                     number of the vehicle passing

                     through the toll?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                                 DEFERLITO

                     (handing in another sheet)

                     This is People's B, a printout from

                     the Department of Motor Vehicles

                     plate registry... Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to that

                     printout, are those numbers on the

                     toll photograph the same ones that

                     are on your own license plate?

                         

          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Yes, the numbers are the same?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     How do you explain that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I can't.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     But that is your car in this

                     photograph, isn't it?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     No, that is not your car?

                     (off his silence)

                     Answer the question, Mr. Grant.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is not my car in this picture.

                     I don't know how you all did that,

                     but this is not my car.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You expect this grand jury to

                     believe that that is not your car

                     when there is a printout from the

                     department of motor vehicles...

                         

                                 EARL

                     That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

                     not permitted to go on record.

                     You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

                     a lot of people.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     And this piece of paper makes

                     everything okay?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, it makes it easier.

                                 ROBERT

                     No.

                                 JIMMY

                     Robert, look: you asked me to come

                     meet you and I'm here, but I came

                     because I wanted to get something

                     straight between us: we're even.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, we're even. But just for the

                     record though, what you did...

                     (picks up the trust document)

                     Was way beyond the money.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Nothing's beyond money for you.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS BACK)

                     Thanks a lot.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (pointing to the document)

                     And if I take this, then what does

                     that say about me?

                         

          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

          his pocket.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

                     and do something good with it.

                         

          Hold on Jimmy.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

                         

          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to

          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:

          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."

                         

========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

====================89====================
          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

                         

========================================
====================103====================
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                                 JULIE

                     You just come in and out whenever

                     you want?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I thought we should talk...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     (laughs, then in a rage)

                     One damn night in a month I told

                     you was important to me, et tu es

                     meme pas capable d'etre la...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...I was working, do you

                     understand? I'm under enormous

                     pressure, I have obligations...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...I don't want to hear about your

                     obligations. If you cared -- YOU

                     WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I was there! I was there! I was

                     late, but I was there. And I'm

                     here now.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     No, no, no. You're here when it's

                     convenient for you to be here.

                     C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

                     YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!



                         

          She walks off into the

                         

                         LIVING ROOM

                         

          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

          downs a red wine.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I'm sorry.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Why did you buy those paintings?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because I liked them.

                         

          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

          her anger.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Okay, thank you for helping me get

                     started. But if I'm gonna fail--

                     then let me fail!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

                     would you fail?

                         

          He crosses towards her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

                     wants to throw money away but if

                     you wanna start a business, you

                     have to project a certain image.

                         

                                 JULIE

                     What image?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Success.

                         

          He sits down next to her.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     The market's a disaster right now;

                     nobody's moving anything. That's

                     why you gotta show sales. People

                     look at you then and they say

                     "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

                     that's what they remember. Always.

                         

          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...



                         

                                 JULIE

                     (QUIETLY)

                     You're never gonna leave her.

                         

          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

                         

                                 CUT TO:

          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

                         

          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Come away with me. Let's just take

                     your car and go...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     ...Where?...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     There's a place upstate. Very

                     beautiful, on the water. We can

                     wake up there together- just you

                     and me. I'd like that.

                         

          She's keeps crying, but...

                         

                                 JULIE

                     Me, too.

          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

                         

          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

                     despite your sentimental history

                                 ROBERT

                     (laughs, plays with his

                     SCOTCH GLASS)

                     I don't know.

                         

          Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

                         

                                 SYD

                     How's Ellen?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She's good. Fine.

                     (stops packing, looks up)

                     Why?

                         

                                 SYD

                     I heard something...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes...?

                         

                                 SYD

                     She met with Gil Deuchman.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The estate lawyer?

                         

                                 SYD

                     Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not to me.

                         

          They sit in silence.

          INT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The

          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next

          to Jimmy.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That was the early morning of April 11th.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You received a phone call?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Who called you?

                         

          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     It was a wrong number.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

                     half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

                     the case that you know exactly who

                     called you and exactly why? Why are

                     you lying to this court?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I'm not lying.

                         

          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm going to introduce into evidence

                     People's A. This is a toll booth

                     photograph taken in the northbound ninth

                     lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to the

                     photograph, would you please read the

                     date and time stamp indicated on the

                     lower right hand corner?

                         

          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is crazy.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (whispers in Jimmy's ear)

                     You're gonna have to answer that.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, please answer the question.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     April 11th, two thirty-three am.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Grant, directing your attention

                     to the same photograph, would you

                     please read the license plate

                     number of the vehicle passing

                     through the toll?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     D D G five five four two.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     (handing in another sheet)

                     This is People's B, a printout from

                     the Department of Motor Vehicles

                     plate registry... Mr. Grant,

                     directing your attention to that

                     printout, are those numbers on the

                     toll photograph the same ones that

                     are on your own license plate?

                         

          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

                     Mr. Grant?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Yes, the numbers are the same?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     How do you explain that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I can't.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     But that is your car in this

                     photograph, isn't it?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     No, that is not your car?

                     (off his silence)

                     Answer the question, Mr. Grant.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is not my car in this picture.

                     I don't know how you all did that,

                     but this is not my car.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     You expect this grand jury to

                     believe that that is not your car

                     when there is a printout from the

                     department of motor vehicles...

                         

                                 EARL

                     That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

                     not permitted to go on record.

                         

========================================
====================105====================
          EXT. OUTDOOR COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

                         

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

                     a lot of people.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     And this piece of paper makes

                     everything okay?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, it makes it easier.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (BEAT)

                     You worried I'm gonna say something?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No.

                         

          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Robert, look: you asked me to come

                     meet you and I'm here, but I came

                     because I wanted to get something

                     straight between us: we're even.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, we're even. But just for the

                     record though, what you did...

                     (picks up the trust document)

                     Was way beyond the money.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (LAUGHS)

                     Nothing's beyond money for you.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS BACK)

                     Thanks a lot.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     (pointing to the document)

                     And if I take this, then what does

                     that say about me?

                         

          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

          his pocket.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

                     and do something good with it.

                         

          Hold on Jimmy.

                         

========================================
====================109====================
          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

                         

          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to

          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:

          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."

                         

========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                                 ROBERT

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                     you I'll look into it.

                     (INTO PHONE)

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 CINDY (O.S.)

                     There's a detective Bryer here to

                     see you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (stiffens, then into phone)

                     Give me two minutes, then send him in...

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Everything alright?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes, my other meeting just got here

                     early. We'll have to pick this up later.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Okay. And Mom wants to know about

                     the hospital check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright?



                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Okay.

                         

          Brooke exits. Robert steels himself.

                         

                                 CINDY (O.S.)

                     Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr.

                     Miller's personal assistant, right

                     this way.

                         

========================================

          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

                         

========================================
====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

====================89====================
          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

                         

========================================
====================103====================
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

                         

========================================
====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.

====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

                         

========================================

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

                         

========================================
====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.



========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                     Yes, your honor.

                         

========================================
====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.



========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

                         

========================================
====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.



========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.



                         

========================================
====================89====================
          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

                         

========================================
====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.



========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Brooke exits. Robert steels himself.

                         

                                 CINDY (O.S.)

                     Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr.

                     Miller's personal assistant, right

                     this way.

                         

========================================

          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

                         

========================================
====================110====================
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.



========================================
====================8====================
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's ridiculous. That can't be right.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     I know, it's ridiculous, and yet...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Okay, I'll look into it. I promise

                     you I'll look into it.

                     (INTO PHONE)

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 CINDY (O.S.)

                     There's a detective Bryer here to

                     see you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (stiffens, then into phone)

                     Give me two minutes, then send him in...

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Everything alright?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes, my other meeting just got here

                     early. We'll have to pick this up later.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Okay. And Mom wants to know about

                     the hospital check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright?



                         

                                 BROOKE

                     Okay.

                         

          Brooke exits. Robert steels himself.

                         

                                 CINDY (O.S.)

                     Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr.

                     Miller's personal assistant, right

                     this way.

          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (SMILES)

                     Your wife home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Home.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                     (SMILES BACK)

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

                         

========================================
====================103====================
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     (BEAT)

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     (BEAT)

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

                         

========================================
====================106====================
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.
