          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         

          A party in progress, dinner already served.

                         

          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

                         

          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (LIGHTING UP)

                     Look, your grandfather's here!

                         

          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

          table, hugging them all.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hi, guys!



                         

                                 GRANDCHILD

                     Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

                         

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

                         

          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

          to his behavior towards their kids.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

                     You're spoiling them rotten.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (GRINNING)

                     It's my job! It's my job. You guys

                     turned out fine!

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     (HALF-SMILE)

                     Debatable.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (to Peter, as they hug and

                     SMILE)

                     How you doin', son? Good?

                         

          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     We had to eat. The kids were

                     starving...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (hugging her, happy)

                     No, no that's okay. Where's my

                     drink, is this mine, here?

                         

          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

                         

                                 ALL

                     HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

                         

          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

          toast.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Thank you, thank you, thank you all

                     very much, it's such a surprise, I

                     didn't even know it was my birthday!

                         

          Everyone laughs a little.



                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     What did Mark Twain say about? He

                     said-- old age... is clearly a case

                     of mind over matter. If you don't

                     mind, it doesn't matter.

                     (MORE LAUGHTER)

                     I've done a lot of things in my life,

                     worked very hard, but being here,

                     looking around-- at all these shining,

                     radiant faces, I know that my best

                     work is right here in this room, right

                     now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

                     That's the best gift your mother and I

                     could have hoped for,

                     (KISSES ELLEN)

                     so, thank you...

                         

                                 PETER

                     (CALLING OUT)

                     ...and to have sold the company

                     to Standard this morning!

                         

          They all LAUGH.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SMILES)

                     That, too, Peter, but- no business

                     tonight-- no business!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, here we go!

                         

          More group LAUGHTER.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Although your one-track mind assures

                     me you've got not only your mother's

                     genes, but you've got mine, too!

                         

          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

          across the room.

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     Now, I'm aware that may seem

                     uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

                     sixty years to realize what's truly

                     important -- and it's you guys so thank

                     you all very much.

                         

                                 ALL

                     (as they applaud)

                     Hear, hear!

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                         

          Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Let's go.

                         

          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

          banged up.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You gonna tell me what this is?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's better you don't ask.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     So all you're sayin' is, you need a

                     ride somewhere.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     That's correct.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Because I want to be very clear

                     about this: you called me to give

                     you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, you're not. We're not here.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     We're both alseep right now. At

                     home. Which is where you left your

                     phone, right?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Right.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Because if anyone checks...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Why is anyone gonna check?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     They're not, as long as we're not here.

                     Anybody know you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Somebody knows you're here?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But somebody knows-- you're not there.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Well, my girl...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Man, you call up two am, what the

                     fuck you want? She asked me where I

                     was going.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What'd you say?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     I told her I had to run out a minute.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Is this the kinda shit you used to

                     do to my dad?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Do you trust her?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     Yes, I fucking trust her!

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

                     home. My wife gets up at five am for

                     Pilates -- I will be there next to

                     her, where I've been all night. And

                     you'll do the same with yours.

                         

          Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     This is some pretty fucked up shit.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Jimmy...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     No, man, come on, I don't hear from

                     you since the fuckin' funeral, you

                     call me up out of the blue, using

                     my father's name, ask me...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     ...what do you want, you want

                     money? I will give you five

                     thousand dollars! I will give you

                     ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

                     whatever you fuckin'...

                         

          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.



                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You wanna talk to me like that you

                     can get the fuck outta my car and

                     you can walk! You want that?! You

                     wanna fuckin' walk home?!

                     (after a beat)

                     Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

                     myself. I need your help.

                         

          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

                         

          Robert winces in pain.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You alright?

                         

          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

                         

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)

                     Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I just... have to get home...

                     I'll deal with it in a couple of

                     hours.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     What if you don't make it a couple

                     of hours?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Then I don't make it.

          Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

          each other.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

                     waiting. You can sit there. We just

                     heard about it. Really terrible.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay, so you were an investor in

                     her gallery?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Correct.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     How'd you meet her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Through... I think it was a charity

                     function. My wife and I have a foundation.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Last night, at the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Did you stay till the doors closed?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I think I left about ten.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Where'd you go?

                                 BRYER

                     You go straight home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You stay home?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah.

                     Yes.

                         

          Bryer shifts, edging forward.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

                     gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     See her with anyone-- what do you

                     mean?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     You know like a boyfriend, someone

                     she might've left with?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

                     located the driver.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     The driver?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, someone else was driving.

                     (BEAT)

                     Sometimes, the driver, will go for

                     help-- and he'll die tryin', you

                     know...



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This is awful. This is truly awful.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We're searching the area right now.

                     So no boyfriend that you know of?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually we didn't talk about

                     personal matters.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     She was just an employee, right?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Well not an employee. I was an investor.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why did I invest?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yeah, why'd you invest?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She had a great eye. She found me

                     (POINTS)

                     those Bryce Marden's there. They

                     went up in value very quickly, and

                     on the basis of that I agreed to

                     fund some of the gallery.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     Would you mind if we searched

                     her apartment?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Why would I mind?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's in your company's name.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

                     go ahead.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, Mr. Miller...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Mmm-hmm?



                         

                                 BRYER

                     Why would you lease an apartment

                     for Ms. Côte? Is that something you

                     normally do for your employees?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Actually I said that she wasn't an

                     employee, but-- I think she'd just come

                     over from Paris if I remember, and she

                     needed a place to entertain buyers.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you leased her this apartment.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It was through our holding company.

                     You seem a little confused by all

                     this...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (LAUGHS)

                     I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Alright.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Now, I don't mean to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     But you're going to be

                     indelicate...

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, from what I've been able to

                     gather, she wasn't exactly an art

                     star. I mean, she worked for a

                     couple a dealers in Paris, but...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

                     I invest in her and help her find

                     a place?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Something like that, yeah.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's very simple, detective. I invest

                     in people I believe in. I thought

                     she'd do well, so I backed her, she

                     did. It's is simple as that.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     (nods, stands as Robert

                     STANDS)

                     Well that seems to make sense.

                     (BEAT)

                     So we're all good with the

                     apartment, then?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Sure.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Thanks.

                         

          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     What happened to your head?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     That's a nasty cut; I've been

                     looking at that for the last five

                     minutes. Does it hurt you?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (touching the cut)

                     Oh, no, I just hit it on the

                     medicine cabinet.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Last night?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     This morning.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Hate when that happens.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah. Me, too.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, thanks for the chat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No problem.

                         

          Bryer heads out.

                         

          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

                         

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

                         

                                 EARL

                     Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     They're lying!

                         

                                 EARL

                     Okay, now here's what...

                         

          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

          to them.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I can halt the decision.

                         

                                 EARL

                     We need a minute, Detective.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

                         

          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Cause if you do we could...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     You can get the fuck outta my face.

                     How `bout that?.



                         

                                 BRYER

                     So you wanna keep playing games? Or

                     you ready to tell me something?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Detective, I need to talk to my client.

                     Now if you would just please...

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     How you- How you all just gonna lie

                     like that? Huh? How you all just

                     gonna lie?!

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We didn't lie. You lied.

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That wasn't my car.

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Sure it wasn't. And it was a

                     telemarketer called you from the pay

                     phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

                     make a late night sale?

                         

                                 JIMMY

                     That picture was some bullshit...

                         

                                 EARL

                     ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

                     going on?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

                     Tell him. See how the boss'll like

                     this one.

                         

          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

                         

                                 BRYER (CONT'D)

                     Last chance.

                         

          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

                         

                                 EARL

                     (rising, to Jimmy)

                     Wait here.

                         

          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

                         

                         CLOSE ON:



                         

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

                         

          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Well they look a little different to me,

                     too... Is there a reason you haven't

                     allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

                     conduct his own analysis?



                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     We've had some issues regarding

                     chain-of-custody...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You don't have them anymore.

                     You're to meet him with the evidence

                     in the next hour.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where's the tape?

                     (ANOTHER BEAT)

                     Am I not speaking loud enough?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Your honor...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Yes?

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     It seems there's been...

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...Let him tell me.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know where it is.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Come again?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     It's not in the evidence locker.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Where is it?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     We don't know.

                         

          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     I'll ask you one last time,

                     detective. Where is the tape?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     (after a beat)

                     We lost it.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Hmmm... In light of these

                     developments, and I would think you

                     should be very happy to hear this,

                     with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

                     to offer Mr. Deferlito the

                     opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

                     the indictment to save us all a

                     bunch of embarrassment.

                         

                                 DEFERLITO

                     I don't feel comfortable with that,

                     your honor.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Further I'm going to put all charges

                     against Mr. Grant under seal.

                     (Bryer starts heading to

                     THE DOOR)

                     This case is dismissed with prejudice

                     and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

                     Detective.

                     (Bryer stops.)

                     If you have another suspect in the

                     automobile death then you are to present

                     him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

                     further inquiry in this matter. This is

                     over. Do I have your understanding?

                         

                                 EARL

                     Thank you.

                         

          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     Close the door, detective,

                     please...

                         

          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

                     You finessed these, didn't you...?

                         

                                 BRYER

                     I'm sorry?

                         

                                 RITTENBAND

                     ...You finessed it. I know it, and

                     you know it.

                         

          No response.



                         

                                 RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

                     I know who you're after. I saw all the

                     evidence, not just the toll photo. You

                     gotta get him the right way.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Oh, okay.

                     (approaches the judge)

                     So let me get this straight: What

                     you're telling me is I'm supposed to

                     sit around with my thumb up my ass

                     and my fingers crossed hoping that

                     one of these fucking days, somewhere

                     down the line, one of these rich

                     assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

                     LOUD enough so that we can't choose

                     to ignore it anymore?

                     Get the fuck outta of my office.

                         

                                 BRYER

                     Yes, your honor.

          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         

          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

          finishing a drink.



                         

          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

                     get there...? I don't wanna get

                     there too soon...

                         

          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

                         

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)

                     (tying his tie)

                     You okay? What is it?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You spoke to Brooke?

                         

          He slows... Something's brewing.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Did she tell you that?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No. She didn't have to.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     ...you explained, did you?

                     (A BEAT)

                     Did you tell her everything?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Everything?

                     (off his silence)

                     Lift up your shirt.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Lift up -- your shirt.

                         

          He doesn't move.

                         

          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

                         

          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                         

          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.



                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     Did you tell her about that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LONG BEAT)

                     Ellen I don't know what you think

                     you know...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

                     You've been sneaking off to see her for

                     months. You don't think I know that?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What do you think you know?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I never cared, really, about your

                     secretaries, your- gallerists,

                     whores, whatever you wanna call them.

                     I cared about our home. And now you

                     have brought this to our door.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     I did what was necessary.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     No you did what was necessary for

                     you, Robert, for your interests.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     For my interests?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Yes.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Everything I do is for us, for this

                     family, and now you're gonna tell

                     me how to run my business.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     This isn't about your business,

                     this is our life! Where do you

                     think we're going tonight? Why do

                     you think I've even tolerated this

                     for so long?

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (he's had enough)

                     What you've tolerated? Wow!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I'm glad you find that funny.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What about me? What about the

                     complaints? The unhappiness? The

                     drinking? The shopping? The

                     trainers? Everything! But yes, the

                     charities, the wonderful sainted

                     charities, you know, all the

                     wonderful works that you do. How do

                     you think I've paid for them?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I didn't ask you because I didn't

                     want you to lie.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (WALKS OFF)

                     It's cause you didn't want to give

                     `em up!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     But I thought that we had an

                     understanding. And you broke that

                     understanding when you brought

                     Brooke into it.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     No, I kept her out.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     When you made Brooke complicit-- when

                     you risked her future-- and I'm done.

                         

          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

          them toward him.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     What is this?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Read it.

                         

          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

          few brief seconds until...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     "All ownership and voting rights

                     transfer to the Miller Charitable

                     Foundation, to be administered by

                     Brooke Miller?" Did you really

                     expect me to sign this thing?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You're not following.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Apparently not, no. No.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (like talking to a child)

                     Okay, uhm, the police have been

                     trying to talk me. I assume they

                     want to know where you were that

                     night. And you know what? I'm not

                     gonna lie for you anymore. Not

                     unless you sign that.

                         

          A beat.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think you'll find a way to

                     manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

                     of things offshore for a rainy day.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     This is fuckin' crazy.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (FAST)

                     No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

                     lie. I'll say you were at home with

                     me that night, all night, together,

                     here, and you'll be free and clear.

                     And the people who need our money

                     will get it. That's my price.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're out of your mind. I am not

                     signing that. I will not sign that!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Well then... I'll have to tell them

                     that you came home at four-thirty

                     bruised and bleeding...

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (LAUGHS)

                     That's fucking ridiculous! What...

                     (crosses close to her)

                     Are you trying to blackmail me?

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I think we call it negotiating.



                         

                                 ROBERT

                     You're not gonna win that one.

                     There's no fucking way.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     You know what, it'll cause just

                     enough trouble- the kind of trouble

                     that you don't want-- In fact,

                     according to my lawyer

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (PACES)

                     Fucking lawyer...

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     It's enough to give them probable

                     cause and then they can subpoena

                     your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     And whatever else they can think of.

                     So really Robert what you have is a

                     choice: you can spend the next three

                     years in court and in the tabloids

                     or-- you can be at your business.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     (SHAKES HEAD)

                     You won't do it. You won't do this.

                     You won't do it to the kids.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     Just try me.

                         

          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

                         

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)

                     (FINALLY CRIES)

                     You broke -- our little girl's heart.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     It's how it all works, Ellen. You

                     know that.

                         

                                 ELLEN

                     I do, but she didn't.

                         

                                 ROBERT

                     She'll be better for it. The world is cold.



                         

                                 ELLEN

                     (turns and heads out)

                     Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

                         

          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

                         

          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

                         

          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

                         

                                 BROOKE

                     ...and to receive this prestigious

                     award, I invite now to the stage

                     the man who led this generous

                     effort, and whose financial trading

                     firm, Miller Capital, has just this

                     morning been acquired by Standard

                     Bank and Trust, a dedicated

                     businessman, family man, scholar,

                     philanthropist and all-around

                     humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

                     call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

                     my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

                         

          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

                         

          FADE TO BLACK.
