        INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                            



        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (surprised, actually feeling

                 tension decline)

                 Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



        Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

        shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                 What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's a long story.  You know, I

                 think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                 That's okay...

                 (pause)

                 ... I have an eye on his private

                 bathroom.



        McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

        to show any).

                                                                       



                                 HOLLY

                 So, where are you staying?  This                     

                 all happened so fast I didn't even

                 ask you on the phone.



        McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                 here a couple years ago.  He said I

                 could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                 Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                 Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                 whole time...Look, let's make this

                 easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                 not huge, but the kids would love to

                 have you at the house.



        McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                 They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                 (beat; honest)

                 I would too.

                                                                       

        They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

        says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



        Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

        door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

        retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

        tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                 ...I've missed you.                                  



                                 MCCLANE

                 Especially my name.  You must miss

                 it every time you write a check.  When

                 did you start calling yourself

                 'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                 (caught)

                 This is a Japanese company, you know?

                 They figure a married woman, she's on

                 the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                 this one particular married woman,

                 she went out the door so fast there

                 was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                 talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                 Didn't we have this same conversation

                 in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                 an opportunity out here -- I had to

                 take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                 No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                 My job and my title and my salary did

                 nothing to our marriage except change

                 your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                 'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                 I never should've let you get those

                 magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                 You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                 It's a partnership where people help

                 each other over the rough spots --

                 console each other when there's a

                 down...and when there's an up, well,

                 hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                 an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                 (quietly)

                 I needed that, John.

                 (pause)

                 I deserved that.



        There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

        say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                 Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                 for you...he wants you to say something

                 to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                 Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                 Oh, this is --



                                 MCCLANE

                 (mock bright 'radio' voice)

                 Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

                 sensitive and supportive man of the

                 eighties.



        Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

        door.



                                 HOLLY

                 I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't I always?



        She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to himself)

                 Schmuck!

        INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME                       



        The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his

        monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the

        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.  As

        they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear

        their conversation.



                                 MAN #1 (THEO)

                 (animatedly)

                 ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,

                 this is a great play -- feeds Worthy

                 on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,

                 back to Worthy in the lane and --



        Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a

        silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the

        Guard can react he pulls the trigger.



                                 THEO

                 (dryly)

                 Boom...two points.



        (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone

        for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the

        desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.



        His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock

        drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video

        monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his

        briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.



                                 THEO

                 We're in.



        ON THE SCREEN                                         



        the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of

        the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the

        service elevator.



========================================
====================26====================
        INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                



        The employees have been herded to the center of the room where

        the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering.



        HOLLY                                                 



        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on

        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        mettle.



        WIDER                                                 



        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her

        hand "reassuringly."



        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He

        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he

        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        his own scribblings like a dais speaker.



                                 HANS

                 (soothing, in control)

                 Ladies and gentlemen, due to the

                 Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of

                 greed around the globe, it is about

                 to be taught a lesson on real power.

                 You...will be witnesses.

                 If our demands are not met, however --

                 (sad smile)

                 -- You may become participants instead.

                 (beat, checking notes)

                 Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is

                 the man who...

                 (slight smile)

                 ...used to be in charge here?



        Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

        Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.



                                 HANS

                 (quite civil)

                 Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My

                 name is Hans Gruber.



        Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the

        direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

        INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                         



        Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone

        seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of

        Wagner.



                                 HANS

                 Nice suit.  John Philips...London?



        Takagi stares at him, speechless.



                                 HANS

                 (smiles)

                 I have two myself.

                 (beat, as he exits:)

                 I'm told Arafat shops there too...

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT       



        Hands enters, looks around.                                      



                                 HANS                                    

                 And when Alexander saw the breadth

                 of his domain, he wept.  For there

                 were no more worlds to conquer.

                 (to Takagi)

                 The benefits of a classical education.



        Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are          

        photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

        Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.



                                 HANS

                 It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed

                 models as a boy.  The exactness, the

                 attention to every foreseeable detail...

                 perfection.



                                 TAKAGI

                 (defensively)

                 This is what this is about?  Out

                 building project in Indonesia?

                 Contrary to what you people think,

                 we're going to develop that region...

                 not 'exploit' it.



        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 I believe you.

                 (smiling)

                 I read the article in Forbes.                          



        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi, we could discuss

                 industrialization of men's fashions

                 all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                 Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                 Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

                 actually...



        JUMP CUT:



        A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:

        sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't have that code...!

                 You broke in here to access out

                 computer?!?  Any information you

                 could get -- they wake up in Tokyo

                 in the morning, they'll change it!

                 You won't be able to blackmail our

                 executives or threaten --



        Hans barks him to silence:



                                 HANS

                 SIT DOWN!



        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.



                                 HANS

                 Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your

                 computer.

                 (beat)

                 I'm interested in the 640 million dollars

                 in negotiable bearer bonds you have in

                 you vault.



        ON Takagi's reaction.



                                 HANS

                 Yes...I know about them.  The code

                 key is a necessary step in accessing

                 the vault.



                                 TAKAGI

                 You want...money?  What kind of

                 terrorists are you?



                                 HANS

                 (amused)

                 Who said we were terrorists?



        MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                        



        He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of

        voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.



        CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                             



        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                 (weighing the gun)

                 The code key, please...?



                                 TAKAGI

                 It's useless to you!  There's seven

                 safeguards on our vault, and the

                 code key is only one of them!  You'll

                 never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.



                                 HANS

                 Then there's no reason not to tell

                 it to us.



                                 THEO

                 It's not over...



        Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,

        turns back to Takagi.



                                 HANS

                 This is too nice a suit to ruin,

                 Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count

                 to three.  There will not be a

                 four.  Give me the code.



        He cocks the gun:



                                 TAKAGI

                 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn

                 jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!

                 I'm telling you!  You're just going

                 to have to kill me --



                                 HANS

                 Okay.



        BANG!!  He pulls the trigger:

        Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back,

        blood flowing out into the carpet.



        Hans springs to his feet:



                                 HANS

                 We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if

                 you can dispose of that. (the body)

                 Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's

        Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.

        stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun

        bumps the underside of the table:



        INSIDE - HANS                                        



        hears it.  Karl is the first to move:

        springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two

        adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is

        locked.

                 ...of the Nakatomi building,

                 sources say that the terrorist

                 leader 'Hans' may be this man,

                 Hans Gruber.



        A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA

        PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans

        has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles

        modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns

        to the office.

                 A member of the radical

                 West German Volksfrei movement.

                 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership

                 issued a communique an hour ago

                 stating that Gruber has been expelled

                 from the organization and is operating

                 on his own.

                 Obviously, Gail whatever his

                 affiliation, it's safe to say

                 that Gruber's terrorist actions

                 in Los Angeles tonight are well,

                 terroristic...



        As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                 ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                 HANS

                 (politely)

                 (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                 HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                 ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                 (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.

                 (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                 ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                 MCCLANE

                 (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                 POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                 POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                 (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

        INTERCUT:



        MCCLANE AND HANS                                    



                                 MCCLANE

                 (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                 HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                 ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                 ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                 ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                 ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                 ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                 MCCLANE

                 (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                 ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                 MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                 HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                 ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                 MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                 (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                 ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.



        CUT TO:

                 (supervising the work)

                 Schnell, schnell...der zeitz ist kurz...



        Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:



        VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                    



        Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages

        coming back into the room!



        CUT TO:



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



        HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)         



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        window on a loop back towards the roof.



        IN THE CHOPPER                                       



        Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY

                 Bank and we'll nail him!



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans whirls towards Kristoff.



                                 HANS

                 Blow the roof.  Now!



                                 KRISTOFF

                 But Karl and Uli are up there --



        CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans

        goes to it.



        THE ROOF                                             



        McClane DIVES away from another burst.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You assholes, I'm on your side -- !



        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.



        LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                 



        The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,

        but they're okay.



        JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                        



        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



        THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                         



        Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation

        PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:



        MCCLANE                                              



        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



        INSIDE THE BUILDING                                  



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



        UP ON THE ROOF                                       



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



        OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                 



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!



        INSIDE                                               



        McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!



        THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                             



        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



        MCCLANE                                              



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:



        THE ROOF                                             



        to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!



        THE HOSTAGES                                         



        They scream, cry out:



        IN THE VAULT ROOM                                    



        As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work

        like automatons, piling up the bonds.



        MCCLANE                                              



        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:



        THE SHAFT                                            



        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like

        schrapnel:



        THE ELEVATOR                                         



        reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:



        WIDE SHOT                                            



        the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in

        on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:



        THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                              



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!

        EXT. BUILDING                                        



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



        HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                    



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



        MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                         



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



        HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                              



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



        IN THE BASEMENT                                      



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



        ARGYLE                                               



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



        THE GARAGE                                           



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



        CLOSER                                               



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.



                                 ARGYLE

                 (looking around)

                 Where's the camera when you need them?



        CUT TO:



        THE VAULT ROOM                                       



                                 HANS

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



        WIDER                                                



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                 MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                 HOLLY

                 John!



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                 (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                 (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                 HANS

                 (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                 (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                 HANS

                 (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                 (to McClane)

                 This time John Wayne does not walk

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.



                                 MCCLANE

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                 HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                 MCCLANE

                 (slowly putting down

                 his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                 HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                 MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



        MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                         



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



        EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS            



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



        MCCLANE                                              



                                 MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                 (he blows smoke

                 from his pistol

                 barrel)

                 We are cowboys.



        VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                   



        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



        HOLLY'S WRIST                                        



        and she is YANKED off her feet!



        BACK TO SCENE                                        



        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane

        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the

        last minute!



========================================
====================116====================
        EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                            



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



        HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                   



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



        MCCLANE                                              



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



        VERY CLOSE                                           



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



        WIDER                                                



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                 MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                 MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.



        DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                 



        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.



        CLOSER                                               



        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (calling out)

                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?



        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet

        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But

        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other

        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,

        is the truth.



                                 MCCLANE

                 (emotional)

                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I

                 couldn't have made it without you.



                                 POWELL

                 Bullshit.



                                 MCCLANE

                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...

                 Holly Gennero.



                                 HOLLY

                 (taking Powell's hand,

                 correcting)

                 Holly McClane.



        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                  



                                 POWELL

                 (to her)

                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't

                 need me to give you that message

                 anymore.



                                 HOLLY

                 (puzzled)

                 Message?



        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's

        direction.



                                 POWELL

                 You know, about him being such a

                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --

                 (seeing McClane)

                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill

                 you in.



        Just then Robinson barges forward.



                                 ROBINSON

                 I want you for debrief, McClane.

                 You've got some things to answer

                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property

                 damage -- interfering with police                     

                 business --



        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.



        HIS P.O.V.                                           



        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.
