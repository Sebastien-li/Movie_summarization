     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

                    ...won four thousand rupees!



     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================
====================51====================
     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.



========================================
====================32====================
     INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                



     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes

     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,

     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,

     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap

     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the

     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.



                                     SALIM

                    Go away. Ja, ja!



     The girl might not even have heard.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    She'll have the Security Guard

                    onto us, standing there.



                                     JAMAL

                    Not if we let her in.



                                     SALIM

                    No.



                                     JAMAL

                    She could be the third

                    musketeer.



                                     SALIM

                    I am the head of this family,

                    now. And I say no. Piss off,

                    you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    We don't even know what the

                    third musketeer's called.



========================================
====================108====================
     INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                



                                     SALIM

                    Hey.



     Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

     swaying with alcohol.



                                     JAMAL

                    Salim?



     He puts his hand out to Latika.



                                     SALIM

                    Come.



                                     JAMAL

                    No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

                    lot to drink...



     Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

     throat and pushes him down on the bed.







                                     SALIM

                    I am the elder. And I am the

                    boss. For once, you do as I say.



                                     JAMAL

                    No.



     Salim pulls Latika to her feet.



                                     SALIM

                    I saved your bloody life, didn't

                    I?



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, please-



                                     SALIM

                    - chup, sali.



     As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

     on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

     course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

     herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

     delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

     door, laughing.



========================================
====================139====================
     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================150====================
     INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Fifteen seconds.



     Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.



                                     PREM

                    Do the right thing and in

                    approximately three minutes you

                    will be as famous as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Ten seconds.







                                     PREM

                    And as rich as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Five seconds.



                                     PREM

                    Almost.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Four, three...



                                     PREM

                    From rags to Raja. It's your

                    destiny.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...we're on.



     Applause from the audience.



                                     PREM

                    Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

                    A Millionaire? In the chair

                    tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

                    don't know! In an amazing run,

                    Jamal has already five million

                    rupees but, not content with

                    that, has chosen to gamble for

                    one Crore- that's ten million

                    million rupees. What a player!

                    The question one more time:

                    Which cricketer has scored the

                    most first class centuries in

                    history. Was it A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

                    Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.



                                     JAMAL

                    I know it isn't Sachin

                    Tendulkar.



                                     PREM

                    That's a start. So, it could be

                    Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

                    Michael Slater.



                                     JAMAL

                    I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

                    fifty.



                                     PREM

                    Okay. Computer, take away two

                    wrong answers.



     Music swells, lights dim.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Well, you were right about

                    Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

                    has taken away A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                    That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                    choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                    or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                    think? Decision time. For half a

                    million rupees. Your answer: B)

                    Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.



     A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

     Prem's eyes.



                                     JAMAL

                    D.



     A barely perceptible jump from Prem.



                                     PREM

                    You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

                    The Australian? Great cricketer.



                                     JAMAL

                    D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Do you know?



     Jamal shakes his head.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?



                                     JAMAL

                    Or D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Final Answer?



                                     JAMAL

                    Final Answer. D.



     A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.



     Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    With one hundred and ninety-

                    seven first class centuries, the

                    answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!



     The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Jamal Malik, Crorepati!



     The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

     disgusted spit. Then he is back on.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    I cannot believe what I am

                    seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen....So, are you ready

                    for the final question for two

                    Crore rupees- twenty million

                    rupees?



                                     JAMAL

                    Not really, but...maybe it is

                    written, no?



                                     PREM

                    Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

                    twenty million rupees, the final

                    question on Who Wants to be a

                    Millionaire?



     The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

     Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

     nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

                    would need a pacemaker fitted,

                    we're out of time! What a show,

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

                    show. Join us tomorrow night to

                    see if Jamal Malik has made the

                    biggest mistake of his life or

                    has just won the biggest prize

                    in the history of Indian

                    television....Same place, same

                    time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                    Goodnight!



     Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

     his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

     and pulls out his mobile.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================188====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             



     A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.



                                     INSPECTOR

                    That's why he's on the show.



     He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.







========================================
====================191====================
     INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                             



     The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

     the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

     an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

     on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

     faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.



========================================
====================2====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...



========================================
====================28====================
     INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                        



                                     PREM

                    ...won four thousand rupees!



     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.

                    Fifteen seconds.

                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.



========================================
====================32====================
     INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                



     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes

     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,

     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,

     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap

     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the

     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.



                                     SALIM

                    Go away. Ja, ja!



     The girl might not even have heard.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    She'll have the Security Guard

                    onto us, standing there.



                                     JAMAL

                    Not if we let her in.



                                     SALIM

                    No.



                                     JAMAL

                    She could be the third

                    musketeer.



                                     SALIM

                    I am the head of this family,

                    now. And I say no. Piss off,

                    you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    We don't even know what the

                    third musketeer's called.



========================================
====================108====================
     INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                



                                     SALIM

                    Hey.



     Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

     swaying with alcohol.



                                     JAMAL

                    Salim?



     He puts his hand out to Latika.



                                     SALIM

                    Come.



                                     JAMAL

                    No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

                    lot to drink...



     Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

     throat and pushes him down on the bed.







                                     SALIM

                    I am the elder. And I am the

                    boss. For once, you do as I say.



                                     JAMAL

                    No.



     Salim pulls Latika to her feet.



                                     SALIM

                    I saved your bloody life, didn't

                    I?



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, please-



                                     SALIM

                    - chup, sali.



     As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

     on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

     course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

     herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

     delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

     door, laughing.



========================================
====================139====================
     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

                    Fifteen seconds.



     Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.



                                     PREM

                    Do the right thing and in

                    approximately three minutes you

                    will be as famous as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Ten seconds.







                                     PREM

                    And as rich as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Five seconds.



                                     PREM

                    Almost.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Four, three...



                                     PREM

                    From rags to Raja. It's your

                    destiny.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...we're on.



     Applause from the audience.



                                     PREM

                    Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

                    A Millionaire? In the chair

                    tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

                    don't know! In an amazing run,

                    Jamal has already five million

                    rupees but, not content with

                    that, has chosen to gamble for

                    one Crore- that's ten million

                    million rupees. What a player!

                    The question one more time:

                    Which cricketer has scored the

                    most first class centuries in

                    history. Was it A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

                    Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.



                                     JAMAL

                    I know it isn't Sachin

                    Tendulkar.



                                     PREM

                    That's a start. So, it could be

                    Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

                    Michael Slater.



                                     JAMAL

                    I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

                    fifty.



                                     PREM

                    Okay. Computer, take away two

                    wrong answers.



     Music swells, lights dim.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Well, you were right about

                    Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

                    has taken away A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                    That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                    choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                    or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                    think? Decision time. For half a

                    million rupees. Your answer: B)

                    Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.



     A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

     Prem's eyes.



                                     JAMAL

                    D.



     A barely perceptible jump from Prem.



                                     PREM

                    You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

                    The Australian? Great cricketer.



                                     JAMAL

                    D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Do you know?



     Jamal shakes his head.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?



                                     JAMAL

                    Or D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Final Answer?



                                     JAMAL

                    Final Answer. D.



     A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.



     Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    With one hundred and ninety-

                    seven first class centuries, the

                    answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!



     The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Jamal Malik, Crorepati!



     The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

     disgusted spit. Then he is back on.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    I cannot believe what I am

                    seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen....So, are you ready

                    for the final question for two

                    Crore rupees- twenty million

                    rupees?



                                     JAMAL

                    Not really, but...maybe it is

                    written, no?



                                     PREM

                    Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

                    twenty million rupees, the final

                    question on Who Wants to be a

                    Millionaire?



     The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

     Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

     nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

                    would need a pacemaker fitted,

                    we're out of time! What a show,

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

                    show. Join us tomorrow night to

                    see if Jamal Malik has made the

                    biggest mistake of his life or

                    has just won the biggest prize

                    in the history of Indian

                    television....Same place, same

                    time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                    Goodnight!



     Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

     his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

     and pulls out his mobile.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================188====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             



     A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.



                                     INSPECTOR

                    That's why he's on the show.



     He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.







========================================
====================191====================
     INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                             



     The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

     the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

     an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

     on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

     faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.



========================================
====================2====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...



========================================

                    ...won four thousand rupees!



     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?



========================================

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================
====================51====================
     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.

                    Fifteen seconds.

                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.

                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

========================================
====================32====================
     INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                



     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes

     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,

     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,

     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap

     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the

     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.



                                     SALIM

                    Go away. Ja, ja!



     The girl might not even have heard.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    She'll have the Security Guard

                    onto us, standing there.



                                     JAMAL

                    Not if we let her in.



                                     SALIM

                    No.



                                     JAMAL

                    She could be the third

                    musketeer.



                                     SALIM

                    I am the head of this family,

                    now. And I say no. Piss off,

                    you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    We don't even know what the

                    third musketeer's called.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                



                                     SALIM

                    Hey.



     Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

     swaying with alcohol.



                                     JAMAL

                    Salim?



     He puts his hand out to Latika.



                                     SALIM

                    Come.



                                     JAMAL

                    No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

                    lot to drink...



     Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

     throat and pushes him down on the bed.







                                     SALIM

                    I am the elder. And I am the

                    boss. For once, you do as I say.



                                     JAMAL

                    No.



     Salim pulls Latika to her feet.



                                     SALIM

                    I saved your bloody life, didn't

                    I?



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, please-



                                     SALIM

                    - chup, sali.



     As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

     on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

     course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

     herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

     delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

     door, laughing.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

     INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Fifteen seconds.



     Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.



                                     PREM

                    Do the right thing and in

                    approximately three minutes you

                    will be as famous as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Ten seconds.







                                     PREM

                    And as rich as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Five seconds.



                                     PREM

                    Almost.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Four, three...



                                     PREM

                    From rags to Raja. It's your

                    destiny.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...we're on.



     Applause from the audience.



                                     PREM

                    Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

                    A Millionaire? In the chair

                    tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

                    don't know! In an amazing run,

                    Jamal has already five million

                    rupees but, not content with

                    that, has chosen to gamble for

                    one Crore- that's ten million

                    million rupees. What a player!

                    The question one more time:

                    Which cricketer has scored the

                    most first class centuries in

                    history. Was it A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

                    Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.



                                     JAMAL

                    I know it isn't Sachin

                    Tendulkar.



                                     PREM

                    That's a start. So, it could be

                    Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

                    Michael Slater.



                                     JAMAL

                    I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

                    fifty.



                                     PREM

                    Okay. Computer, take away two

                    wrong answers.



     Music swells, lights dim.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Well, you were right about

                    Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

                    has taken away A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                    That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                    choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                    or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                    think? Decision time. For half a

                    million rupees. Your answer: B)

                    Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.



     A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

     Prem's eyes.



                                     JAMAL

                    D.



     A barely perceptible jump from Prem.



                                     PREM

                    You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

                    The Australian? Great cricketer.



                                     JAMAL

                    D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Do you know?



     Jamal shakes his head.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?



                                     JAMAL

                    Or D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Final Answer?



                                     JAMAL

                    Final Answer. D.



     A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.



     Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    With one hundred and ninety-

                    seven first class centuries, the

                    answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!



     The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Jamal Malik, Crorepati!



     The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

     disgusted spit. Then he is back on.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    I cannot believe what I am

                    seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen....So, are you ready

                    for the final question for two

                    Crore rupees- twenty million

                    rupees?



                                     JAMAL

                    Not really, but...maybe it is

                    written, no?



                                     PREM

                    Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

                    twenty million rupees, the final

                    question on Who Wants to be a

                    Millionaire?



     The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

     Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

     nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

                    would need a pacemaker fitted,

                    we're out of time! What a show,

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

                    show. Join us tomorrow night to

                    see if Jamal Malik has made the

                    biggest mistake of his life or

                    has just won the biggest prize

                    in the history of Indian

                    television....Same place, same

                    time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                    Goodnight!



     Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

     his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

     and pulls out his mobile.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================188====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             



     A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.



                                     INSPECTOR

                    That's why he's on the show.



     He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.







========================================
====================191====================
     INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                             



     The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

     the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

     an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

     on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

     faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.



========================================
====================2====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...



========================================
====================28====================
     INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                        



                                     PREM

                    ...won four thousand rupees!



     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?



========================================
====================31====================
     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================
====================51====================
     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.

                    Fifteen seconds.

                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.

                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                    millionaire!



                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.



========================================
====================32====================
     INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                



     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes

     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,

     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,

     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap

     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the

     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.



                                     SALIM

                    Go away. Ja, ja!



     The girl might not even have heard.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    She'll have the Security Guard

                    onto us, standing there.



                                     JAMAL

                    Not if we let her in.



                                     SALIM

                    No.



                                     JAMAL

                    She could be the third

                    musketeer.



                                     SALIM

                    I am the head of this family,

                    now. And I say no. Piss off,

                    you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    We don't even know what the

                    third musketeer's called.



========================================
====================108====================
     INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                



                                     SALIM

                    Hey.



     Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

     swaying with alcohol.



                                     JAMAL

                    Salim?



     He puts his hand out to Latika.



                                     SALIM

                    Come.



                                     JAMAL

                    No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

                    lot to drink...



     Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

     throat and pushes him down on the bed.







                                     SALIM

                    I am the elder. And I am the

                    boss. For once, you do as I say.



                                     JAMAL

                    No.



     Salim pulls Latika to her feet.



                                     SALIM

                    I saved your bloody life, didn't

                    I?



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, please-



                                     SALIM

                    - chup, sali.



     As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

     on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

     course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

     herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

     delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

     door, laughing.



========================================
====================139====================
     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================150====================
     INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Fifteen seconds.



     Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.



                                     PREM

                    Do the right thing and in

                    approximately three minutes you

                    will be as famous as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Ten seconds.







                                     PREM

                    And as rich as me.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Five seconds.



                                     PREM

                    Almost.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    Four, three...



                                     PREM

                    From rags to Raja. It's your

                    destiny.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...we're on.



     Applause from the audience.



                                     PREM

                    Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

                    A Millionaire? In the chair

                    tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

                    don't know! In an amazing run,

                    Jamal has already five million

                    rupees but, not content with

                    that, has chosen to gamble for

                    one Crore- that's ten million

                    million rupees. What a player!

                    The question one more time:

                    Which cricketer has scored the

                    most first class centuries in

                    history. Was it A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

                    Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.



                                     JAMAL

                    I know it isn't Sachin

                    Tendulkar.



                                     PREM

                    That's a start. So, it could be

                    Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

                    Michael Slater.



                                     JAMAL

                    I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

                    fifty.



                                     PREM

                    Okay. Computer, take away two

                    wrong answers.



     Music swells, lights dim.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Well, you were right about

                    Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

                    has taken away A) Sachin

                    Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                    That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                    choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                    or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                    think? Decision time. For half a

                    million rupees. Your answer: B)

                    Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.



     A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

     Prem's eyes.



                                     JAMAL

                    D.



     A barely perceptible jump from Prem.



                                     PREM

                    You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

                    The Australian? Great cricketer.



                                     JAMAL

                    D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Do you know?



     Jamal shakes his head.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?



                                     JAMAL

                    Or D. Jack Hobbs.



                                     PREM

                    Final Answer?



                                     JAMAL

                    Final Answer. D.



     A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.



     Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    With one hundred and ninety-

                    seven first class centuries, the

                    answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!



     The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Jamal Malik, Crorepati!



     The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

     disgusted spit. Then he is back on.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    I cannot believe what I am

                    seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen....So, are you ready

                    for the final question for two

                    Crore rupees- twenty million

                    rupees?



                                     JAMAL

                    Not really, but...maybe it is

                    written, no?



                                     PREM

                    Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

                    twenty million rupees, the final

                    question on Who Wants to be a

                    Millionaire?



     The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

     Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

     nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

                    would need a pacemaker fitted,

                    we're out of time! What a show,

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

                    show. Join us tomorrow night to

                    see if Jamal Malik has made the

                    biggest mistake of his life or

                    has just won the biggest prize

                    in the history of Indian

                    television....Same place, same

                    time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                    Goodnight!



     Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

     his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

     and pulls out his mobile.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.



                                     INSPECTOR

                    That's why he's on the show.



     He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.

     INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                             



     The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

     the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

     an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

     on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

     faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.



========================================
====================2====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

                    Prem, cue applause...



     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?



========================================

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?

                    I'm- I'm safe.

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                    millionaire!



                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.

     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

     INT. STUDIO/ INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                 



                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

                    ...three, two, one, zero. Cue

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

     INT. STUDIO/ INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                 



                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?



========================================

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                



     The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

     mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

     cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

     chamber, snaps the chamber shut.



                                     TALKBACK (V.O.)

     Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

     A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

     Music, lights, applause.

                    One more question before the

                    commercial break. What will our

                    Call Centre Assistant do next?



     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Religion! Interesting. For

                    sixteen thousand rupees,

                    in depictions of the God Ram, he

                    is famously holding what in his

                    right hand? Is it A) a flower.

                    B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

                    a bow and arrow?

     EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                    



     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.

     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly

     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.



                                     JAMAL

                    We should go back.



     Silence.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    See if Ama-



     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a

     moment. But only a moment.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    What about Jeevan Chacha?



     Salim shakes his head.



                                     JAMAL (CONT'D)

                    Maybe he-



     Salim shakes his head again.



                                     SALIM

                    - I saw him. He was with them.



                                     JAMAL

                    But he wouldn't hurt-



                                     SALIM

                    - he was with them!



                                     JAMAL

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - shut up, Jamal, can't you?

                    Just shut up!



     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and

     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps

     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds

     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja!



     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across

     the city. Rain begins to come down.



                                     JAMAL

                    What shall we do?







     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a

     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their

     faces.



========================================

     INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                        



     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a

     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and

     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He

     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with

     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning

     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks

     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or

     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on

     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.



                                     JAMAL

                    He must be a very good man to

                    look after these people.



                                     SALIM

                    (glancing at them)

                    A saint.



     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim

     overhears.



                                     ARVIND

                    We're not allowed to talk to

                    them.



                                     LATIKA

                    Why not?



     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman

     who is looking right at them.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    Well, if there are seconds,

                    Maman is definitely a Saint.



     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.

     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out

     laughing.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    I tell you, Lord Siva is with

                    us.

     EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                             



     Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.



                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am the new cook from the

                    agency. A thousand apologies, I

                    am late for the Memsaab.



     The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

     pause, he returns.



                                     DOOR-KEEPER

                    She doesn't know anything about

                    any cook. There's supposed to be

                    a dishwasher being delivered.

                    Know anything about that?







                                     JAMAL

                    Baba, I am your dishwasher!



     The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

     Latika appears at the gate.



                                     LATIKA

                    Haven't I told you, don't

                    interrupt when I'm watching-



     She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.



                                     LATIKA (CONT'D)

                    - come inside. I'll show you the

                    kitchen.



========================================
====================157====================
     EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           



     Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

     rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

     thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

     the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

     the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

     screaming.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    What's going on?



                                     PREM

                    He's a cheat.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    This was you? You called them?



     Prem shrugs.



                                     DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

                    How d'you know he's cheating?







                                     PREM

                    Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                    He's a bloody village boy. Even

                    when I fed him the wrong answer

                    the little shit got it right.



     Director stares at him.



                                     DIRECTOR

                    You gave him an answer?



                                     PREM

                    Well, I didn't exactly-



     The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

     doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Nita?



     But she too turns and walks away.



========================================
====================162====================
     INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                



     Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

     running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

     of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

     the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

     behind him. Stares at the tv.



                                     SALIM

                    That boy. He will never give up.

                    Never.



     He shakes his head.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Crazy chutiyé.



     Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

     towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Ja. Go.



                                     LATIKA

                    But-



                                     SALIM

                    - just drive. There won't be

                    another chance. Go.



     Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.



                                     LATIKA

                    He'll kill you.



     Salim smiles, shakes his head.



                                     SALIM

                    It is not written.



                                     JAVED (O.S.)

                    Salim!



     Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

     her.



                                     LATIKA

                    Salim, I....can't.



     Salim points at the television.



                                     SALIM

                    You have to. It'll take you two

                    hours if you drive fast. Here.



     He holds out his mobile phone.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For God's sake, hold on to it.





     Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

     head for a moment.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    For what I have done, please

                    forgive me.



     Salim releases her.



                                     SALIM (CONT'D)

                    Go. Have a good life.



     Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

     Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

     INT. STUDIO/ INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                 



                                     PREM

                    Okay! So, Latika, you want to

                    hear the question one more time?

                    And let's be clear about this.

                    Twenty million rupees ride on

                    your answer. You have thirty

                    seconds. Jamal, please read out

                    the question to Latika.



                                     JAMAL

                    Is that really you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    Yes.



                                     PREM

                    The question, Jamal.



                                     JAMAL

                    In Alexandre Dumas' book, The

                    Three Musketeers, two of the

                    musketeers are called Athos and

                    Porthos. What was the name of

                    the third musketeer. Was it A)

                    Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,

                    C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.



     Silence. The electronic clock ticks loudly.



                                     PREM

                    Fifteen seconds.



                                     JAMAL

                    Where are you?



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I'm- I'm safe.



                                     PREM

                    Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do

                    you think?



     Silence.





                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Five, four, three, two, one.

                    Time's up! Your answer.



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I don't know.



     The audience groan.



                                     PREM

                    Oh...



                                     LATIKA (V.O.)

                    I've never known.



                                     PREM

                    You really are on your own, now,

                    Jamal. Your answer: for twenty

                    million rupees.



     Jamal shrugs.



                                     JAMAL

                    A.



                                     PREM

                    A. Because?



                                     JAMAL

                    Just...because.



                                     PREM

                    Apka final jawab?



                                     JAMAL

                    Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.



     The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs

     around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his

     computer. Stares hard at Jamal.



                                     PREM

                    Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                    Jamal Malik, Call Centre

                    Assistant from Mumbai, for two

                    Crore, twenty million rupees,

                    you were asked who the Third

                    Musketeer was in the novel by

                    Alexandre Dumas. You used your

                    final life-line to phone a

                    friend. You answered A.

                    Aramis.....which is...I have to

                    tell you...the correct answer!



     Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

     to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

     smiling, but disorientated.







                                     PREM (CONT'D)

                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

                    Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

                    We have all been present at the

                    making of history, Ladies and

                    Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

                    millionaire!



                                     JAMAL

                    Latika? Latika?



     To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

     audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.
