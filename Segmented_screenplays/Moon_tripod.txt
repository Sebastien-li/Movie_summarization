INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                     



Sam on his morning run.

INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                               



Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the

shower.



                                SAM

                    Morning, Gerty.



                                GERTY

                    Morning, Sam. How are you today?



                                SAM

                    Fine. Fine.



                                GERTY

                    How's the hand?



                                SAM

                    It's a little sore.



Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden

model -- strides out again.

INT. CORRIDOR                                               



Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign

of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.



Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS

out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires

around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.



GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.



Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:



                                SAM

                    Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!



Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down

the corridor.



                                GERTY

                    What happened?



                                SAM

                    Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

                    maybe? Either way there might be

                    damage to the exterior shell. I'd

                    better go outside and take a

                    look.



                                GERTY

                    There is no damage to the

                    exterior shell.



                                SAM

                    It's not that I don't believe

                    you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

                    springing leaks like an ACME fire

                    hose. Maybe you better let me

                    take a look, just in case, huh?



                                GERTY

                    Sam, I'm not supposed to let you

                    go outside.



                                SAM

                    Then let's keep it between you

                    and me then. Ok?







The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this

through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects

at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily

repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:



                                GERTY

                    Okay, Sam.



The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam

this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he

immediately takes off down the corridor --

Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table

playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.



Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.



                                SAM 1

                    You're Sam Bell.



Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.



Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,

purposefully keeping his distance.







                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    I'm Sam Bell, too.



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah.



Sam 1 nods. A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    This is fucked up.



                                SAM 2

                    Completely.



Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

put together a coherent thought.



                                SAM 1

                    Why... What are you?



For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

Then:



                                SAM 2

                    I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

                    clone.



                                SAM 1

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 2

                    About a week.



A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    How are you getting on?



                                SAM 2

                    (repeating the question

                    slowly)

                    How am I getting on?

                    (then)

                    The company ordered Gerty to lock

                    all the exits. I haven't been

                    able to do anything for seven

                    days but sit on my ass.



                                SAM 1

                    They locked all the exits? What

                    about the harvesters?



                                SAM 2

                    Slowed them down to half speed,

                    apparently.

                    And then when I finally trick

                    Gerty into letting me outside I

                    find a clone of myself in a

                    crashed rover. How am I getting

                    on? Oh I'm loving it.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm not a clone.



                                SAM 2

                    Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.



                                SAM 1

                    You're the clone.

                    I didn't know it could get so

                    thick. Does it itch?



                                SAM 1

                    No, not really.

                    Listen, I wanted to say thank-

                    you. If it wasn't for you I'd

                    still be out there in the crashed

                    rover. You saved my life.

                    (then)

                    Will you shake my hand?



Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile

Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.

                                SAM 1

                    You look just like me. It's

                    incredible.



                                SAM 2

                    Why do I look like you? Why don't

                    you look like me?

MIRROR



Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a

MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has

subsided



Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

hell of a FRIGHT.



The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.



                                SAM 1

Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the
