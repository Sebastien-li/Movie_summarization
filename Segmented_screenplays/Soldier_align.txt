     The VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous.

     NATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER!

     INT.  BEDROOM - DAY



     A VIPER writhes across the floor through the patterns of light 

     streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace

     and evil designs.



     The VIPER winds its way toward an object that will prove in a

     moment to be a corner of the bad.



     SMACK!  The VIPER doesn't make it!  SMACK!  Another blow from

     MACE's heavy boot being swung by hand.



     The VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous.



     SMACK!  The boot again!



     NATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER!



     SMACK!  NATHAN hits again and...



     MACE rolls over in the bed.



     SMACK!  MACE comes awake, looks around.



     MACE lunges from the bed.



     SMACK!  Just as NATHAN gives the damaged VIPER another blow, MACE 

     snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away.



     SANDRA sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed.



     MACE is holding NATHAN, staring down at the VIPER.



     The VIPER has up the ghost, lying on the floor.



     MACE hugs NATHAN to him and looks toward SANDRA.  They both look

     at the boot.  And at the dead VIPER.



     Their eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each

     other.

     INT.  CRAWLER



     Through the scope, the GUNNER aims again and watches another

     chunk of turbine disintegrate.



     The GUNNER glances at the robot-faced driver.  Their eyes meet.

     CAINE 607 nods.  Obviously, they've killed the two men.



     The GUNNER points to the cable.



     CAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the

     vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike.

     INT.  CORRIDOR



     Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, 

     weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers

     after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid 

     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.



                                   SANDRA

                    Sergeant Todd!



     ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps

     ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.

     INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT



     NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself

     on a wall, keeps going.



     He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a

     console like robots.  They don't look up.



     NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.

     EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY



     Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain.

     Something makes him glance back over his shoulder.



     Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain.



     TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs 

     maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running.



     Then he looks back again.



     The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer.



     TODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back

     again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks.



     IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly,

     keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man

     moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD 

     weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine,

     inexorable.



     As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming

     ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we...

     INT.  WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT (FLASHBACK)



     Silent and surreal, the events of 1986 continue with the PASSIVE

     FOUR-YEAR-OLD sitting on the floor while the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-

     OLD looks down at him, and other FOUR-YEAR-OLDS gather ominously.



     It's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious

     blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this

     passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD.  The boys don't fight like 

     children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows.



     Highly-polished shoes, sharply creased trousers, and eyes

     glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the

     faceless OBSERVERS who make no move to interrupt the violence.



     FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD, his nose pouring blood, exchanges savage

     hurtful blows with his opponent, bloodying him viciously, as

     we...

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)



     Eyes!  The adult TODD blinks away the memory, stares straight

     ahead...



     into NATHAN'S face, only six inches from his own.



     They're all alone in the room.  It's very quiet.



     NATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to

     touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their 

     friendship...

     ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes.  Dangerous.  He draws his face back

     enough to avoid being touched.



     NATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he

     realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again...



     Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something

     catches his eye.



     TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN.



     NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game.



     TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN.



     NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that

     kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly "thanks for the boot"

     smile.



     TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now.



     NATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's

     supposed to do.



     TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand.



     The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling.



     NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD.



     TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a 

     message in his eyes.



     The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes...



     TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the

     snake and flips it a couple of feet.



     NATHAN stares.



     The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again.



     NATHAN looks at TODD.



     TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes.



     NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea.



     The VIPER is about to strike again...



     SQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it.



     TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down

     for NATHAN.  As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he

     glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury.



     TODD meets the look without blinking.  He never blinks.



                                   SANDRA (O.S.)

                    What happened?



     TODD turns to see SANDRA standing in the bedroom door, her eyes

     almost as hard as TODD's as we...
