INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     



Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================
====================23====================
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.



========================================
====================64====================
INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================73====================
EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:

====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam on his morning run.







========================================

INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                               



Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the

shower.



                                SAM

                    Morning, Gerty.



                                GERTY

                    Morning, Sam. How are you today?



                                SAM

                    Fine. Fine.



                                GERTY

                    How's the hand?



                                SAM

                    It's a little sore.



Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden

model -- strides out again.

====================69====================
INT. CORRIDOR                                               



Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign

of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.



Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS

out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires

around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.



GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.



Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:



                                SAM

                    Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!



Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down

the corridor.



                                GERTY

                    What happened?



                                SAM

                    Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

                    maybe? Either way there might be

                    damage to the exterior shell. I'd

                    better go outside and take a

                    look.



                                GERTY

                    There is no damage to the

                    exterior shell.



                                SAM

                    It's not that I don't believe

                    you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

                    springing leaks like an ACME fire

                    hose. Maybe you better let me

                    take a look, just in case, huh?



                                GERTY

                    Sam, I'm not supposed to let you

                    go outside.



                                SAM

                    Then let's keep it between you

                    and me then. Ok?







The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this

through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects

at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily

repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:



                                GERTY

                    Okay, Sam.



The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam

this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he

immediately takes off down the corridor --

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table

playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.



Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.



                                SAM 1

                    You're Sam Bell.



Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.



Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,

purposefully keeping his distance.







                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    I'm Sam Bell, too.



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah.



Sam 1 nods. A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    This is fucked up.



                                SAM 2

                    Completely.



Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

put together a coherent thought.



                                SAM 1

                    Why... What are you?



For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

Then:



                                SAM 2

                    I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

                    clone.



                                SAM 1

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 2

                    About a week.



A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    How are you getting on?



                                SAM 2

                    (repeating the question

                    slowly)

                    How am I getting on?

                    (then)

                    The company ordered Gerty to lock

                    all the exits. I haven't been

                    able to do anything for seven

                    days but sit on my ass.



                                SAM 1

                    They locked all the exits? What

                    about the harvesters?



                                SAM 2

                    Slowed them down to half speed,

                    apparently.

                    And then when I finally trick

                    Gerty into letting me outside I

                    find a clone of myself in a

                    crashed rover. How am I getting

                    on? Oh I'm loving it.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm not a clone.



                                SAM 2

                    Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.



                                SAM 1

                    You're the clone.

                                SAM 2

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 1

                    Almost three years.



                                SAM 2

                    Hence the Captain's beard.



                                SAM 1

                    (with a smile)

                    Right.



                                SAM 2

                    I didn't know it could get so

                    thick. Does it itch?



                                SAM 1

                    No, not really.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Listen, I wanted to say thank-

                    you. If it wasn't for you I'd

                    still be out there in the crashed

                    rover. You saved my life.

                    (then)

                    Will you shake my hand?



Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile

Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.



                                SAM 2

                    (self-conscious)

                    What?







                                SAM 1

                    You look just like me. It's

                    incredible.



                                SAM 2

                    Why do I look like you? Why don't

                    you look like me?



                                SAM 1

                    We look like each other, I guess.



This final line intended as a kind of truce.

MIRROR



Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a

MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has

subsided



Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

hell of a FRIGHT.



The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.



                                SAM 1

                    Who are you?

Sam 1 inside the crashed rover, resembling a wild animal

pinned in a trap. He's still breathing.







SAM 1'S DREAM



Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the

blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.



                                TESS

                    Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!



Sam begins to walk towards Tess.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     



Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================
====================23====================
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.

                    Tess would know.

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.

INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam on his morning run.







========================================
====================45====================
INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                               



Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the

shower.



                                SAM

                    Morning, Gerty.



                                GERTY

                    Morning, Sam. How are you today?



                                SAM

                    Fine. Fine.



                                GERTY

                    How's the hand?



                                SAM

                    It's a little sore.



Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden

model -- strides out again.

====================69====================
INT. CORRIDOR                                               



Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign

of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.



Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS

out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires

around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.



GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.



Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:



                                SAM

                    Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!



Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down

the corridor.



                                GERTY

                    What happened?



                                SAM

                    Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

                    maybe? Either way there might be

                    damage to the exterior shell. I'd

                    better go outside and take a

                    look.



                                GERTY

                    There is no damage to the

                    exterior shell.



                                SAM

                    It's not that I don't believe

                    you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

                    springing leaks like an ACME fire

                    hose. Maybe you better let me

                    take a look, just in case, huh?



                                GERTY

                    Sam, I'm not supposed to let you

                    go outside.



                                SAM

                    Then let's keep it between you

                    and me then. Ok?







The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this

through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects

at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily

repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:



                                GERTY

                    Okay, Sam.



The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam

this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he

immediately takes off down the corridor --

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table

playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.



Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.



                                SAM 1

                    You're Sam Bell.



Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.



Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,

purposefully keeping his distance.







                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    I'm Sam Bell, too.



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah.



Sam 1 nods. A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    This is fucked up.



                                SAM 2

                    Completely.



Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

put together a coherent thought.



                                SAM 1

                    Why... What are you?



For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

Then:



                                SAM 2

                    I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

                    clone.



                                SAM 1

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 2

                    About a week.



A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    How are you getting on?



                                SAM 2

                    (repeating the question

                    slowly)

                    How am I getting on?

                    (then)

                    The company ordered Gerty to lock

                    all the exits. I haven't been

                    able to do anything for seven

                    days but sit on my ass.



                                SAM 1

                    They locked all the exits? What

                    about the harvesters?



                                SAM 2

                    Slowed them down to half speed,

                    apparently.

                    And then when I finally trick

                    Gerty into letting me outside I

                    find a clone of myself in a

                    crashed rover. How am I getting

                    on? Oh I'm loving it.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm not a clone.



                                SAM 2

                    Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.



                                SAM 1

                    You're the clone.

The two Sam's are inspecting plants.



                                SAM 2

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 1

                    Almost three years.



                                SAM 2

                    Hence the Captain's beard.



                                SAM 1

                    (with a smile)

                    Right.



                                SAM 2

                    I didn't know it could get so

                    thick. Does it itch?



                                SAM 1

                    No, not really.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Listen, I wanted to say thank-

                    you. If it wasn't for you I'd

                    still be out there in the crashed

                    rover. You saved my life.

                    (then)

                    Will you shake my hand?



Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile

Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.



                                SAM 2

                    (self-conscious)

                    What?







                                SAM 1

                    You look just like me. It's

                    incredible.



                                SAM 2

                    Why do I look like you? Why don't

                    you look like me?



                                SAM 1

                    We look like each other, I guess.

this going on for a few seconds.







MIRROR



Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a

MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has

subsided



Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

hell of a FRIGHT.



The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.



                                SAM 1

                    Who are you?



No answer.

SAM 1'S DREAM



Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the

blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.



                                TESS

                    Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                               



Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the

shower.



                                SAM

                    Morning, Gerty.



                                GERTY

                    Morning, Sam. How are you today?



                                SAM

                    Fine. Fine.



                                GERTY

                    How's the hand?



                                SAM

                    It's a little sore.



Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden

model -- strides out again.

INT. CORRIDOR                                               



Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign

of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.



Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS

out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires

around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.



GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.



Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:



                                SAM

                    Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!



Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down

the corridor.



                                GERTY

                    What happened?



                                SAM

                    Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

                    maybe? Either way there might be

                    damage to the exterior shell. I'd

                    better go outside and take a

                    look.



                                GERTY

                    There is no damage to the

                    exterior shell.



                                SAM

                    It's not that I don't believe

                    you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

                    springing leaks like an ACME fire

                    hose. Maybe you better let me

                    take a look, just in case, huh?



                                GERTY

                    Sam, I'm not supposed to let you

                    go outside.



                                SAM

                    Then let's keep it between you

                    and me then. Ok?







The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this

through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects

at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily

repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:



                                GERTY

                    Okay, Sam.



The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam

this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he

immediately takes off down the corridor --

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table

playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.



Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.



                                SAM 1

                    You're Sam Bell.



Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.



Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,

purposefully keeping his distance.







                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    I'm Sam Bell, too.



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah.



Sam 1 nods. A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    This is fucked up.



                                SAM 2

                    Completely.



Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

put together a coherent thought.



                                SAM 1

                    Why... What are you?



For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

Then:



                                SAM 2

                    I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

                    clone.



                                SAM 1

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 2

                    About a week.



A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    How are you getting on?



                                SAM 2

                    (repeating the question

                    slowly)

                    How am I getting on?

                    (then)

                    The company ordered Gerty to lock

                    all the exits. I haven't been

                    able to do anything for seven

                    days but sit on my ass.



                                SAM 1

                    They locked all the exits? What

                    about the harvesters?



                                SAM 2

                    Slowed them down to half speed,

                    apparently.

                    And then when I finally trick

                    Gerty into letting me outside I

                    find a clone of myself in a

                    crashed rover. How am I getting

                    on? Oh I'm loving it.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm not a clone.



                                SAM 2

                    Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.



                                SAM 1

                    You're the clone.

                    Almost three years.

                    Hence the Captain's beard.

                    (with a smile)

                    Right.



                                SAM 2

                    I didn't know it could get so

                    thick. Does it itch?



                                SAM 1

                    No, not really.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Listen, I wanted to say thank-

                    you. If it wasn't for you I'd

                    still be out there in the crashed

                    rover. You saved my life.

                    (then)

                    Will you shake my hand?



Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile

Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.



                                SAM 2

                    (self-conscious)

                    What?







                                SAM 1

                    You look just like me. It's

                    incredible.



                                SAM 2

                    Why do I look like you? Why don't

                    you look like me?



                                SAM 1

                    We look like each other, I guess.

Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a

MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has

subsided



Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

hell of a FRIGHT.



The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.



                                SAM 1

SAM 1'S DREAM



Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the

blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.



                                TESS

                    Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

========================================

INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                               



Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the

shower.



                                SAM

                    Morning, Gerty.



                                GERTY

                    Morning, Sam. How are you today?



                                SAM

                    Fine. Fine.



                                GERTY

                    How's the hand?



                                SAM

                    It's a little sore.



Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden

model -- strides out again.

INT. CORRIDOR                                               



Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign

of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.



Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS

out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires

around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.



GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.



Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:



                                SAM

                    Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!



Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down

the corridor.



                                GERTY

                    What happened?



                                SAM

                    Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

                    maybe? Either way there might be

                    damage to the exterior shell. I'd

                    better go outside and take a

                    look.



                                GERTY

                    There is no damage to the

                    exterior shell.



                                SAM

                    It's not that I don't believe

                    you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

                    springing leaks like an ACME fire

                    hose. Maybe you better let me

                    take a look, just in case, huh?



                                GERTY

                    Sam, I'm not supposed to let you

                    go outside.



                                SAM

                    Then let's keep it between you

                    and me then. Ok?







The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this

through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects

at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily

repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:



                                GERTY

                    Okay, Sam.



The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam

this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he

immediately takes off down the corridor --

INT. REC ROOM                                               



Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table

playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.



Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.



                                SAM 1

                    You're Sam Bell.



Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.



Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,

purposefully keeping his distance.







                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    I'm Sam Bell, too.



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah.



Sam 1 nods. A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    This is fucked up.



                                SAM 2

                    Completely.



Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

put together a coherent thought.



                                SAM 1

                    Why... What are you?



For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

Then:



                                SAM 2

                    I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

                    clone.



                                SAM 1

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 2

                    About a week.



A beat.



                                SAM 1

                    How are you getting on?



                                SAM 2

                    (repeating the question

                    slowly)

                    How am I getting on?

                    (then)

                    The company ordered Gerty to lock

                    all the exits. I haven't been

                    able to do anything for seven

                    days but sit on my ass.



                                SAM 1

                    They locked all the exits? What

                    about the harvesters?



                                SAM 2

                    Slowed them down to half speed,

                    apparently.

                    And then when I finally trick

                    Gerty into letting me outside I

                    find a clone of myself in a

                    crashed rover. How am I getting

                    on? Oh I'm loving it.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm not a clone.



                                SAM 2

                    Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.



                                SAM 1

                    You're the clone.

                    How long have you been here?



                                SAM 1

                    Almost three years.



                                SAM 2

                    Hence the Captain's beard.



                                SAM 1

                    (with a smile)

                    Right.



                                SAM 2

                    I didn't know it could get so

                    thick. Does it itch?



                                SAM 1

                    No, not really.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Listen, I wanted to say thank-

                    you. If it wasn't for you I'd

                    still be out there in the crashed

                    rover. You saved my life.

                    (then)

                    Will you shake my hand?



Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile

Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.



                                SAM 2

                    (self-conscious)

                    What?







                                SAM 1

                    You look just like me. It's

                    incredible.



                                SAM 2

                    Why do I look like you? Why don't

                    you look like me?



                                SAM 1

                    We look like each other, I guess.



This final line intended as a kind of truce.

MIRROR



Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a

MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has

subsided



Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

hell of a FRIGHT.



The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.



                                SAM 1

                    Who are you?



No answer.

Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================
====================23====================
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================73====================
EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     



Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================
====================23====================
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.

INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    You said that thing had already

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================73====================
EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.



CUT TO:

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================

INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

INT. REC ROOM                                             



Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --



                                SAM 1

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                 



The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.



========================================
====================23====================
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

over him.



                                SAM 2

                    What about the other clones?



"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    (indicating the model)

                    You said that thing had already

                    been started when you got here.

                    Well, who started it?

                    (then)

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No

INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few

knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky

tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --



                                SAM (V.O.)

                    I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

                    never alone...



We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.



PHOTOGRAPH



Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms

wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    Because I have you.



Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife

of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive

hairdo.



Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly

beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave

behind.



Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.



                                SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                    And I have Eve. I don't take you

                    guys for granted. You know that

                    now.

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as

Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank

and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.



Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back

of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and

dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                          



Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --

not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once

safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in

the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.



Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to

indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.



Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of

Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a

special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.



A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.



Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses

out of the Harvester carefully.

INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                      



Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video

message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,

examining it as he listens to the video.



The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the

screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like

vultures right now than lizards.



                                THOMPSON

                    Sam, we appreciate the offer, but

                    you concentrate on feeling

                    better.







                                SAM

                    (muttering, vexed)

                    Oh for Christ's sake...



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We don't want you to take any

                    unnecessary risks. You're too

                    important to us.



                                THOMPSON

                    You're to stay put, understand?



                                OVERMEYERS

                    It's an order.



                                THOMPSON

                    It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

                    Stay put.



                                OVERMEYERS

                    We're going to send a Rescue Unit

                    to tend to the stalled harvester

                    and get the base back on its

                    feet.



                                SAM

                    (incensed)

                    Why?



The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as

good as a kick in the balls.



                                GERTY

                    I'm sorry Sam.



Sam stares at Gerty.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    Sam, I am under strict orders not

                    to let you outside.



Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at

the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his

feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the

room.

EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                      



Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes

apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of

the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what

that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.







THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

inside.



Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

turns the unconscious man onto his back.



He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans

down even closer.



CLOSE UP -- THE MAN



Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

the film.



Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the

REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has

just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.



WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER



Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious

Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him

to the parked Rover.

"Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    Yeah, we might not be the first

                    two to be woken up.

                    You said that thing had already

                    Well, who started it?

                    There might be other clones up

                    here right now. Think about it.

                    How did I get here so quickly                         

                    after your crash? They didn't

                    ship me in from Central, there

                    wasn't time. I must have come

                    from the base.



                                SAM 1

                    That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        

                    Why would hey do that?                                



                                SAM 2

                    I bet there's some kind of secret

                    room --

                    (laughing)

                    Secret room?



                                SAM 2

                    Yeah, secret room, why not?







                                SAM 1                                       

                    (losing his cool)                                 

                    You're the one who's lost the

                    plot! I've been here for three

                    years. I know every inch of this

                    base. I know how many dust fibres

                    are between those wall panels

                    over there -- why would they do                       

                    that?!                                                



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Look. It's a company, right?                          

                    They have investors, shareholders                     

                    -- shit like that. What's                             

                    cheaper? Spending time and money                      

                    training new personnel or just                        

                    have a couple of spares here to                       

                    do the job. If they make it                           

                    through their contract, great.                        

                    If they don't, hallelujah! No                         

                    contract completion fees, no                          

                    retirement package. Just thaw out                     

                    the spare, and keep the profits                       

                    rolling in. It's the far side of                      

                    the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       

                    haven't even fixed our                                

                    communications satellite.                             



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know.                                      



                                SAM 2                                       

                    Do you really think they give a                       

                    shit about us? They're laughing                       

                    all the way to the bank!                              



                                SAM 1                                       

                    Tess would know what's going on!                      

                    She wouldn't let that happen!                         



                                SAM 2                                       

                    (exhasperated)                                    

                    There's some area we don't know                       

                    about. I'm going to find it.                          



Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden

house, starts whittling.



Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.



========================================
====================115====================
INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            



Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --



WIDE SHOT



Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.



Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.



ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.



Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         

so he is only sending audio.                                       



A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.



                                SAM 1

                    Come on...come on...



Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.



And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.



Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.



The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:



                                GIRL

                    Hello?







That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:



                                SAM 1

                    Uh, Bell residence?



The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.



The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.



                                GIRL

                    This is the Bell Residence.



                                SAM 1

                    I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.



The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --



                                GIRL

                    I'm sorry, she passed away some

                    years ago.



Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.



                                SAM 1

                    No...no way.



The girl just stares.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    Tess Bell? Are you sure?



                                GIRL

                    Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

                    daughter.

                    (then)

                    Can I help you?



And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.



The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.



Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.



                                SAM 1

                    Eve?



Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.







                                EVE BELL

                    Yes?



A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.



                                SAM 1

                    (overwhelmed)

                    Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

                    now?



For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.



                                EVE BELL

                    I'm fifteen.

                    (then)

                    Do I know you?



                                SAM 1

                    How did mom die, sweetheart?



                                EVE BELL

                    Uh...



Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:



                                EVE BELL (CONT'D)

                    Dad!



And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.



                                SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                    What!



                                EVE BELL

                    Dad, there's someone asking about

                    mom...



Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     



                                SAM'S VOICE

                    Who's asking about mom?



Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.



He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.







========================================
====================129====================
INT. REC ROOM                                               



We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.



                                SAM 2

                    When the Rescue Unit arrives

                    they'll expect to find a body in

                    the crashed Rover, right?

                    (a beat)

                    We've got our body.



                                SAM 1

                    (points towards the

                    Infirmary)

                    That guy?



Sam 2 nods.



                                SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                    They'll expect to find a dead

                    body in the crashed Rover.



                                SAM 2

                    I know.



                                SAM 1

                    (stunned)

                    You're going to kill him?



                                SAM 2

                    Someone's got to pull the short

                    straw here, better someone who's

                    unconscious than you or me.







Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    If we go through with this, I'm

                    going to need your help hauling

                    him out to the crash site.



                                SAM 1

                    What about us? Eliza arrives,

                    finds you and me as the welcome

                    party --



                                SAM 2

                    They're not going to find you and

                    me as the welcome party, they're

                    going to find me. You're going to

                    blast back to Earth before they

                    get here in one of the Helium 3

                    containers.

                    (a beat)

                    You're going home.



Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    You've done your three years. I

                    can't expect you to stick around.

                    Maybe you can meet Eve in person.



A beat.



                                SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                    I saw the message on the VP. Eve

                    is beautiful. She looks like her

                    mom.



Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.



They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:



                                SAM 1

                    How do you think she died?



                                SAM 2

                    I don't know.

                    (then)

                    Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

                    was in the family. Who knows? Or

                    maybe it was an accident? Could

                    have been a million things.



                                SAM 1

                    I wish I'd been there.







                                SAM 2

                    Yeah. Me too.



The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.



CUT TO:



========================================
====================142====================
INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                            



Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.



Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.



Gerty glides in as he works.



                                GERTY

                    Sam, this is not going to work.                        



                                SAM 2

                    What? Why not?                                         







Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!



                                GERTY

                    If the Rescue Unit examine my

                    memory banks they will discover

                    what has taken place over the

                    last week. As you know I record

                    everything. If they are

                    suspicious, the first thing they

                    will do is search my memory

                    banks, and this would put you in

                    considerable danger.



Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.



The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.



                                GERTY (CONT'D)

                    I recommend erasing my memory

                    banks. I can reboot myself once

                    you have departed.



                                SAM 2                                       

                    So that's what we're going to

                    have to do.

                    (beat)                                             

                    Are you ok with that?                                  



                                GERTY

                    I'll require your assistance,                          

                    Sam.                                                   



                                SAM 2

                    Sure, just let me finish this.



Sam 2 continues his work.
