    One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. The

    place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a

    cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom. Now Trevor

    heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the

    corridor. He clutches the desecrated physical science

    book. A student slides down the banister past him.

    :SC: INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - MORNING



    Trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as

    the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is

    teeming with teenagers.



    Into SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to

    DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind.

    His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of

    deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis,

    Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell.



    VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap

    between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial

    expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a

    hundred times.



    Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white

    handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his

    baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a

    ten-penny nail imbedded in it.

    (AFTER SCHOOL)



    as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as

    suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the

    cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.



    A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to

    discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.



                                ELLEN

               May I come in?













                                TREVOR

               Yeah...

               (points at her)

               ... Ellen.



                                ELLENA

               (pointing back)

               Trevor.



    He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged

    over the clock.



                                TREVOR

               (explaining)

               I'm making time a reward instead

               of a distraction.



    Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.



                                ELLEN

               Clever... Listen, I wanted to

               apologize for jumping up like I

               did at lunch. I was just feeling

               a little weird...



                                TREVOR

               It's alright.



                                ELLEN

               For what it's worth, Dave

               Childress thinks you walk on

               water.



                                TREVOR

               Is that a good thing?



    Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.



                                ELLEN

               I think it takes a lot of

               courage to go back into a

               classroom after something like

               that.



                                TREVOR

               Not if the only thing you ever

               wanted to do was teach.



                                ELLEN

               (smiles)

               Now you see, there's our

               predicament.











    WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the

    window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

               I assume you've met Benny Chacon?



                                TREVOR

               I have.



                                ELLEN

               (absently)

               Last week Benny and his tagging

               crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in

               the corner over there.

               (pointing)

               ... She's seven months pregnant

               and he's tormenting her with a

               broom handle... Can I help you

               with those?



    Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

    but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.

    Ellen sees he's in pain.



                                TREVOR

               No thanks.



    She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.



                                ELLEN

               So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

               and if the district construes it

               as assault and battery on a

               student, she's gone.



                                TREVOR

               They'd do that?



                                ELLEN

               In a heart beat. She's non-

               tenured, they don't want to get

               sued...

               (with resignation)

               Don't be surprised if she files

               for stress leave by the end of

               the week. Too bad, too. She's a

               good teacher.



    WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.

    The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.



                                ELLEN

               Can I ask you a personal question?











    Trevor glances up.    Here's what she really wants to

    know...



                                ELLEN

               (tentatively now)

               Why'd that kid attack you?



                                TREVOR

               Because I flunked him.



                                ELLEN

               (sobered)

               Is there any way you can see

               something like that coming?



                                TREVOR

               When they say they wanna kill you,

               you'd best take it serious. This

               kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

               Transfer -- but nobody told me

               until it was too late.



    A beat.



                                ELLEN

               Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

               In less than a year he's been

               convicted of felony assault and

               suspended twice. I even testified

               against him as a character witness.

               Now I get to see him every day in

               homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

               Condition of his probation is

               that he stay in school.



                                TREVOR

               You talk to the principal?



                                ELLEN

               Many times... Three weeks ago,

               Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

               a conference, but she refuses to

               show up. She's afraid they'll

               deport her because she's illegal.

               So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

               some attorney tells her she

               doesn't have to come in.

               (still can't

               believe)

               Garcia got cold feet and dropped

               the whole thing.

               (fear building)

               This kid's threatening me and all

               he's worried about is a lawsuit.











                                TREVOR

               (intent now)

               What'd Benny say to you?



    Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for

    an awkward moment as she collects herself.



                                ELLEN

               That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

               bad.



                                TREVOR

               Does he know where you live?



                                ELLEN

               I think so. Someone's been phoning

               me at night and hanging up... Two

               weeks ago, my car was broken into...

               And last Friday, I think he was

               inside my house... But I can't

               prove it.



    The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the

    bungalow.



                                ELLEN

               (bottom lip quivers)

               ... I don't know what to do.



                                TREVOR

               You can quit.



                                ELLEN

               You didn't.



    OFF Trevor's severe gaze...

    :SC: EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS - NIGHT



    Merging with Cesar as he slinks down the dark alley

    corridor. Lighting a blunt off his Zippo lighter...



    FURTHER DOWN



    Cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint.

    He takes another hit. Chokes down a shit-eating grin. And

    admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt.



    ... below the dog he scrawls the word, "CARTOON." Above

    it, "K.O.S." As he slips the spray can into his front

    pocket, he senses a presence..



                                CESAR

               ... 'At you, Stevie?



    Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes

    another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts

    past him.



                                CESAR

               (startled)

               ... Hells, man. Stupit dog.



    His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a

    premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as

    a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left

    pectoral muscle.



    Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow.

    An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls

    the arrow out of his chest and studies it...



    The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half

    and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic

    needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has

    retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the

    solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and

    into Cesar).



                                CESAR

               ... Mutha fuck.



    Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he

    turns and runs off.

    Standing room only.    An impassioned crowd.



                                ANGLO WOMAN

               ... I wanna know if this boy was

               killed and whether it was gang-

               related.



    The audience erupts in unanimous support...



                                ANGLO WOMAN

               (playing to crowd now)

               As a mother and a taxpayer, I have

               a right to know. And if it was

               gang-related then I want tighter

               security...



    At this point she's drowned out by the crowd.



    On stage the discipline committee, including Trevor,

    Childress, Hyland and Quinn sit at the dais. Garcia

    stands at the podium, waiting for silence. MRS. FORD,

    the assistant principal, a full-figured black woman in

    her mid-fifties, stands alongside him, gesturing for

    the crowd to settle down.



                                MR. GARCIA

               The death...

               (too noisy)

               The death of Benito Chacon is not

               gang-related.

               That's something you heard on

               the news. It's wrong. It's

               misinformation.



                                HISPANIC MAN

               (shouting out)

               Who says? How can you be so sure?

               You're talking about my kid's

               safety.



                                MRS. FORD

               Please, everyone just calm down.



    Audience settles.



                                MR. GARCIA

               Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

               (now)

               ... The police at this point

               aren't even sure if it's a case of

               murder. The reason we're having

               this meeting tonight is to quash

               all the rumors floating around out

               there. Okay. Here's what we do

               know. Benny Chacon ultimately died

               from a drug overdose, technically

               it was morphine.

               (volume rising again)

               Which is what heroin breaks down

               into...



                                STEVIE (O.S.)

               ... Dat's bullshit! Benny was no

               junkie! I know who did it!



    Heads turn...



    ... Ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside

    one of the doors at the back of the hall...



    Up at the dais, Trevor notices her.



                                STEVIE

               It's not the gangbangers y'gotta

               worry about. It's the teachers!



                                MR. GARCIA

               That's exactly the type of rumor

               we don't need, Mr. Littleton.



    Stevie deliberately stands and points at Trevor with

    vitriol in his eyes...













                                STEVIE

               ... It was Garfield.



    The audience grows silent.



                                MR. GARCIA

               (losing his patience)

               Say one more word and you're

               suspended.



                                MRS. FORD

               ... Sit down, Stevie.



    Trevor doesn't even flinch.       Childress scrutinizes him

    with a glance.



                                STEVIE

               (ranting)

               You're a fuckin' murderer,

               Garfield!



                                MR. GARCIA

               (calling for assistance)

               Victor?



                                STEVIE

               ... Maybe I can't prove it but I

               know he did it. He fucked up

               Cesar and he killed Benny.

               (to crowd)

               Ask 'im!



    As Victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove

    Stevie...



                                STEVIE

               Touch me and I'll sue yer ass!

               (as Victor backs off;

               now to Trevor)

               Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man!



    With that Stevie shoves Victor aside and bolts for the

    door.



    Garcia attempts to regain his composure...



    Trevor glances back to the spot where Ellen was

    standing... but now she's gone.

    :SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING



    Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

    disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

    someone moving in his house.



                                TREVOR

               I'm in here, Cesar.



    Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.



                                CESAR

               Dont' move, mutha fucka!



    Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

    the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

    his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.



                                CESAR

               You killed Benny. And you cut off

               my finger... Say it.



    Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah.   I did.



                                STEVIE

               Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.



                                PACO

               Lemme do 'im.



                                CESAR

               No.   This nigga's mine.



    Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

    ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.



    Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a

    fist to reveal six bullets.



                                CESAR

               Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?



    CUT TO:















    ANOTHER ANGLE



    In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

    table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

    other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

    into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

    as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                CESAR

               You gon' do yourself, mayate.

               Put it to your head and pull the

               trigger.



    Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

    his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

    He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

    A crazed, watery glint in his eye.



                                TREVOR

               That macho enough for you, Cesar?

               Huh? That make me a man?



                                CESAR

               Take more'n that.



                                TREVOR

               Then you do it.



    All three tag-bangers are taken aback.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano

               a mano.



                                STEVIE

               He's playin' with yer head.



                                PACO

               Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist

               outta it.



                                TREVOR

               I gotta be a fool to prove you're

               a fool? -- okay.



    Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and

    pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.



                                TREVOR

               C'mon.



                                CESAR

               Tha's not how we playin' it.













                                TREVOR

               Why -- you too chickenshit to play

               yer own game? Got no cojones?



    Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing

    blood.



                                PACO

               Shut up!



    Cesar stares at him.



                                TREVOR

               You gonna let your homies defend

               your punk ass, Cesar? You gonna

               let me dis you? I pulled three

               times, you pussy, you leva, you

               coward! Lessee you pull one.

               C'mon, be a man! Get some respect

               back! Do it!



    Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.



                                PACO

               Whatcho doin', homie?



    He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.



                                CESAR

               (to Trevor)

               You disrespectin' me, vato?   You

               sayin' I ain't a man?



                                TREVOR

               I'm sayin' you're a fool.



    Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...



                                STEVIE

               Don't do it!



    They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth

    and pulls the trigger. Click.



                                PACO

               (instant adulation)

               You the man, Cesar! You the man!

               Orale, vato!

               (to Trevor)

               He got character, homes.



                                STEVIE

               Crazy mutha fucka.





    Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another

    bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.



                                CESAR

               Yer turn.



    He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.



                                TREVOR

               You think you got respect now?

               Your kinda respect is bullshit.

               Only thing you honor is stupidity.

               You ready to die for stupidity,

               Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

               somethin'. See you can't kill me,

               homeboy. Yeah, my body... but

               what I am, who I was? That's

               been dead for over a year. And

               I'm never gonna get it back -- no

               matter how many of you I get rid

               of. I realize that now...

               (furious)

               ... I was a teacher! I wanted to

               help you!...



    He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

    trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

    table.



                                TREVOR

               You can't kill me... and you can't

               scare me.



    Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

    on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.



                                PACO

               Don't do it, homie.



                                STEVIE

               He's crazy.



                                TREVOR

               Yeah, but isn't that what you

               respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen

               to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live

               stupid don't do it half-assed --

               take it all the way. Take your

               turn. Pull the trigger.



    Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,

    Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is

    screaming at him.











                                TREVOR

               Macho is bullshit, fool! Your

               whole way of life is BULLSHIT!



    Cesar explodes to his feet and screams right back.



                                CESAR

               It's all I got!



    Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look.



                                TREVOR

               Well then, I'll take your turn for

               you...



    He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head...



                                CESAR

               No!



    ... pulls the trigger.       BLAM!!   The SHOT knocks Trevor

    out of his chair.





    ON PACO AND STEVIE



                                PACO

               You see dat!    He's out! He's

               fuckin' out!    Snuffed hisself!

               Aw, shit!



    Stevie's stunned.



                                STEVIE

               What'd he do that for?



    He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.



                                STEVIE

               ... Let's get outta here.



    Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.



                                PACO

               C'mon, homie.



                                CESAR

               He took my turn.















                                PACO

               ... What?



                                CESAR

               It was my turn. He took it...

               He dissed me.



                                PACO

               So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead!

               Let's go!



    Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357.



                                CESAR

               I gotta do this.



                                PACO

               Fuck dis shit!     Leave it!



    He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

    but Cesar shoves him off.



                                CESAR

               I got one chance in six. I'm

               'onna beat 'dis bitch... For

               honor, vato.



                                STEVIE

               No!!



    Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM!

    of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at

    Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.



                                STEVIE

               Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why?



    ON PACO AND STEVIE



    Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

    kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

    him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

    Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

               ... Last night tragedy struck in

               North Hollywood where a high

               school teacher and one of his

               students were both found shot

               to death inside the teacher's home.



    V.O. continues through the...
