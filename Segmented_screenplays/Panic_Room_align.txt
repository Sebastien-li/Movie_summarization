     EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY

     

     Closer still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No

     time to waste admiring the scenery.

     

========================================
====================3====================
     EXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY

     

     Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women

     hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate

     broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a

     stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with

     her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine

     year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a

     basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher

     than Meg, who she resembles.

     

     Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.

     

                          LYDIA

               -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five

               feet deep, forty-two hundred square

               feet, four floors with a rentable

               basement apartment, so five

               altogether, courtyard in back --

     

                          MEG

               Could you slow down a little?

               (looking back over her

               shoulder)

               Or we could wait for the car...

     

                          LYDIA

               No cars.  Feet are faster.

     

                          MEG

               How many more do we have after this?

     

                          LYDIA

               None, there's nothing else, you know

               how tight the market is.

     

                          MEG

               This is it?  I told you on the

               phone, I have to be moved in in two

               weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce

               that here.

     

                          SARAH

               Mom, it's the sidewalk.

     

                          LYDIA

               Oh, that miserable little prick is

               already leaving.

     

     They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story

     townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or

     more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front

     door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them

     coming.

     

                          EVAN

               One day you will learn to respect

               other people's time, Lydia, one day

               you --

     

                          LYDIA

               Evan, I am so sorry, you were a

               saint to wait for us!

     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

     

                          EVAN

               And we emerge in the master bedroom.

     

     He checks his watch.

     

     Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She

     looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next

     door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the

     window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.

     

                          MEG

               Something's weird.

     

                          LYDIA

               What?

     

                          MEG

               I don't know, doesn't that corner

               seem funny to you?

     

     She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to

     the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the

     closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look

     closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly

     toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which

     the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than

     it is.

     

                          EVAN

               I was waiting to see if you'd

               notice!  On caravan, no one from our

               office had the slightest idea.

     

     He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a

     faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He

     pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty

     degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the

     closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look

     closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.

     

     Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,

     twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and

     the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and

     Lydia step forward, fascinated.

====================74====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     -- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding

     is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's

     trying to smash their way right through the wall.

     

     Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that

     handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her

     to try to bring her out of it.

     

                          SARAH

               THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING

               IN!

     

     Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another

     deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.

     

     BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both

     hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.

     

                          SARAH

               YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK

               OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY

               HERE WITH ME!

     

                          MEG

               I am.  I'm here.

     

                          SARAH

               YOU HAVE TO!

     

                          MEG

               I'm here.  I'm here.

     

     They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat

     from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her

     head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,

     tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an

     ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing

     digital display:

     

     120

     

     Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.

     

                          MEG

               We're fine.  We're okay.

     

     She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell

     they're doing out there.

     

========================================
====================81====================
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     

     In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.

     Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on

     the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and

     hurls him aside.

     

     Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at

     Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,

     trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their

     voices down.

     

     It's bedlam.

     

========================================
====================82====================
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She

     turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the

     streamers still stream.

     

     She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found

     the waterproof matches and lighters.

     

     She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube

     and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches

     up a screwdriver.

     

     Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,

     but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.

     

     In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof

     blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her

     disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of

     air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.

     

     She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the

     shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the

     vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,

     she unscrews the vent cover.

     

     The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,

     past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the

     wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.

     

     INSIDE THE DUCT,

     

     we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her

     fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it

     once.

     

     Too slow.  Not even a spark.

     

     Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with

     the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it

     makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the

     duct with a hollow BOOM.

     

========================================
====================145====================
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

     

     As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying

     sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the

     doorway of the master bedroom.

     

     She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,

     reaches the end, throws the door open --

     

========================================
====================165====================
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     

     Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,

     but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam

     with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the

     same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.

     

     Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.

     

     Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.

     

     Raoul jabs the button --

     

     -- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one

     at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is

     broken, the door will not close.

     

     Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah

     flying across the room.

     

     Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the

     beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over

     again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then

     breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.

     

     But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it

     up, her head trembles --

     

     -- and collapses onto the floor.

     

     The beam completes --

     

     -- Raoul SMACKS the red button --

     

     -- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He

     reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but

     Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --

     

     -- into the gap --

     

     -- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door

     that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.

     

     Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on

     tight.

     

     The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.

     Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.

     

     Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.

     

     They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face

     contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.

     

     She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.

     

     He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
