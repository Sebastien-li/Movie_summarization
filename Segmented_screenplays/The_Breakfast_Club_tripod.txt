====================5====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     There are six tables in two rows of three.

     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in

     and sits at the table behind her.



     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire

     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.



     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process.



     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to

     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian

     reluctantly gets up and moves.



     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up.



     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the

     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind

     Brian.



     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.



     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.



     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack

     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with

     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the

     job.



                             VERNON

               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

               to congradulate you for being on

               time...



     Claire raises her hand.



                             CLAIRE

               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

               been a mistake.  I know it's

               detention, but...um...I don't think

               I belong in here...



     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.



                             VERNON

               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

               exactly eight hours and fifty-four

               minutes to think about why you're

               here.  To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again.



     Claire looks like she is going to gag.



                             VERNON

               ...and you may not talk.  You will

               not move from these seats.



     He glances up at Bender and points at him.



                             VERNON

               ...and you...



     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.



                             VERNON

               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,

               we're gonna try something a little

               different today.  We are going to

               write an essay--of no less than a

               thousand words--describing to me

               who you think you are.



                             BENDER

               Is this a test?



     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice

     of Bender.



                             VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay.

               I do not mean a single word repeated

               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

               Bender?



     Bender looks up.



                             BENDER

               Crystal...



                             VERNON

               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself.  Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return.



     Brian raises his hand and then stands.



                             BRIAN

               You know, I can answer that right

               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.

               'cause...



                             VERNON

               Sit down Johnson...



                             BRIAN

               Thank you sir...



     He sits.



                             VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points.



                             VERNON

               ...is right across that hall.  Any

               monkey business is ill-advised...



     He looks around at them.



                             VERNON

               ...any questions?



                             BENDER

               Yeah...I got a question.



     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.



                             BENDER

               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

               wardrobe?



                             VERNON

               I'll give you the answer to that

               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

               Don't mess with the bull young man,

               you'll get the horns.



     Vernon leaves.



                             BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is

     Allison, biting her nails.



     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is

     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.



                             BENDER

               You keep eating your hand and you're

               not gonna be hungry for lunch...



     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.



                             BENDER

               I've seen you before, you know...



     We see Vernon look out from his office.



     We see Brian playing with his pen.



                             BRIAN

               (quietly to himself)

               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

               Who are you?



     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip.



                             BRIAN

               I am a walrus...



     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices

     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--

     embarrassed.



     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the

     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing

     his jacket.



     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands

     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket

     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still

     staring at him.



                             BRIAN

               It's the shits, huh?



     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable

     laugh.



     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He

     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's

     head.



     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender.



     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a

     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”



                             CLAIRE

               (to herself)

               I can't believe this is really

               happening to me...



     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.



                             BENDER

               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss?



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Please...



                             BENDER

               If you gotta go...



     We hear Bender unzip his fly.



                             BENDER

               You gotta go!



     Everyone is now looking at Bender.



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Oh my God!



                             ANDREW

               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!



                             BENDER

               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

               it crawl back up!



                             ANDREW

               You whip it out and you're dead

               before the first drop hits the

               floor!



     Bender gasps mockingly.



                             BENDER

               You're pretty sexy when you get

               angry...grrr!



     He turns to Brian.



                             BENDER

               Hey, homeboy...



     Brian points at himself with his pen.



                             BENDER

               ...why don't you go close that door.

               We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated!



     Claire turns and glares at him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!



     Bender ignores him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!

                             BENDER

               What?



                             ANDREW

               If I lose my temper, you're totalled

               man!



                             BENDER

               Totally?



                             ANDREW

               Totally!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

               here is interested!



                             ANDREW

               Really!

               (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface!



                             BENDER

               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

               get in here?  Forget to wash your

               jock?



                             BRIAN

               (nervous)

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

               should just write our papers...



                             ANDREW

               (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off!



     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.



                             BENDER

               It's a free country...



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               of you!  Just ignore him...



                             BENDER

               (to Claire)

               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if

               you tried!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             BENDER

               So...so!

               (to Andrew and Claire)

               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-

               friend?

               (a beat)

               Steady dates?

               (another beat)

               Lo--vers?

               (another beat)

               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do

               you slip her the hot...beef...

               injection?



     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.



                             CLAIRE

               (screams)

               Go to hell!



                             ANDREW

               (screams)

               Enough!



     CUT TO:

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.



                             VERNON

               Coffee...looks like they scrape it

               off the bottom of the Mississippi

               river.  Everything's polluted,

               everything's polluted...the coffee.



     Bender comes out of the library doors followed

     bye veryone else.



     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.

     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the

     end of the line, Allison is following.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               How do you know where Vernon went?



                             BENDER

               I don't...



                             CLAIRE

               Well then, how do you know when he'll

               be back?



                             BENDER

               I don't...being bad feels pretty

               good, huh?



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               What's the point in going to Bender's

               locker?



                             ANDREW

               Beats me...



                             BRIAN

               This is so stupid...Why do you think,

               why are we risking getting caught?



                             ANDREW

               I dunno...



                             BRIAN

               So then what are we doing?



                             ANDREW

               You ask me one more question and I'm

               beating the shit out of you!



                             BRIAN

               Sorry...



     Bender opens his locker.



                             ANDREW

               Slob!



                             BENDER

               My maid's on vacation.



     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...



                             ANDREW

               Screw that Bender...put it back!



     Bender walks away.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.



     Claire walks after Bender.



                             BRIAN

               That was marijuana!



                             ANDREW

               Shut up!



     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison

     who is standing there with her mouth open.



                             BRIAN

               Do you approve of this?



     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of

     Bender's locker.



     We see the crowd walking down the hall.



                             BENDER

               We'll cross through the lab, and

               then we'll double back.



                             ANDREW

               You better be right, if Vernon cuts

               us off it's your fault, asshole!



                             BRIAN

               (to Claire)

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?



     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various

     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon

     until they stop.



                             BENDER

               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We

               have to go through the cafeteria!



                             ANDREW

               No, the activities hall.



                             BENDER

               Hey man, you don't know what you're

               talking about!



                             ANDREW

               No you don't know what you're

               talking about!



     Allison squeaks.



                             ANDREW

               Now we're through listening to you,

               we're going this way.



     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by

     an iron gate.



                             ANDREW

               Shit!



                             BENDER

               Great idea Jagoff!



                             ANDREW

               Fuck you!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to

               John?



                             BRIAN

               We're dead!



                             BENDER

               No, just me!



                             BRIAN

               What do you mean?



                             BENDER

               Get back to the library, keep your

               unit on this!



     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's

     underwear.



     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an

     airborne ranger...”



     We see Vernon hear Bender.



     The rest of them run.



                             VERNON

               That son of a bitch!



     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in

     the gym.



     Bender is going up for a basket.



                             BENDER

               Three...two...one!



     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.



                             VERNON

               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is

               this?  What are you doing here, what

               is this?



                             BENDER

               Oh, hi!



                             VERNON

               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's

               over!



                             BENDER

               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?



                             VERNON

               Out!



                             BENDER

               I'm thinking of trying out for a

               scholarship.



                             VERNON

               Gimmie the ball, Bender.



     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball

     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.



     They leave.

====================31====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================31====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that

     order on the railing.



                             CLAIRE

               Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah?



                             CLAIRE

               Are you gonna write your paper?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, why?



                             CLAIRE

               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of

               us to write our paper, don't you

               think?



                             BRIAN

               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us

               to do...



                             CLAIRE

               True, but I think we'd all kinda

               say the same thing.



                             BRIAN

               You just don't want to write your

               paper...Right?



                             CLAIRE

               True, but, you're the smartest,

               right?



                             BRIAN

               (with pride)

               Oh, well...



                             CLAIRE

               We trust you...



     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in

     approval.



                             ANDREW

               Yeah...



                             BRIAN

               All right, I'll do it...



                             CLAIRE

               Great...



     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Allison)

               Come on...



                             ALLISON

               Where're we going?



                             CLAIRE

               Come on!



     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.



                             CLAIRE

               Don't be afraid.



                             ALLISON

               Don't stick that in my eye!



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not sticking it, just close...

               just go like that...



     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.



                             CLAIRE

               Good...



     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.



                             CLAIRE

               You know you really do look a lot

               better without all that black shit

               on your eyes...



                             ALLISON

               Hey...I like that black shit...



                             CLAIRE

               This looks a lot better...look up.



     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.



     We see Andrew just thinking.



     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still

     putting make-up on Allison.



                             ALLISON

               Please, why're you being so nice to

               me?



                             CLAIRE

               'Cause you're letting me.



     We see Brian begin to write.



     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     The five are walking down the hall where they are met

     by Carl, sweeping up.  Brian nods at him.



                             CARL

               See ya Brian...



                             BRIAN

               Hey Carl...



                             BENDER

               (to Carl)

               See you next Saturday...



                             CARL

               You bet!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================5====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     There are six tables in two rows of three.

     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in

     and sits at the table behind her.



     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire

     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.



     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process.



     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to

     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian

     reluctantly gets up and moves.



     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up.



     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the

     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind

     Brian.



     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.



     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.



     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack

     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with

     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the

     job.



                             VERNON

               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

               to congradulate you for being on

               time...



     Claire raises her hand.



                             CLAIRE

               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

               been a mistake.  I know it's

               detention, but...um...I don't think

               I belong in here...



     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.



                             VERNON

               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

               exactly eight hours and fifty-four

               minutes to think about why you're

               here.  To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again.



     Claire looks like she is going to gag.



                             VERNON

               ...and you may not talk.  You will

               not move from these seats.



     He glances up at Bender and points at him.



                             VERNON

               ...and you...



     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.



                             VERNON

               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,

               we're gonna try something a little

               different today.  We are going to

               write an essay--of no less than a

               thousand words--describing to me

               who you think you are.



                             BENDER

               Is this a test?



     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice

     of Bender.



                             VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay.

               I do not mean a single word repeated

               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

               Bender?



     Bender looks up.



                             BENDER

               Crystal...



                             VERNON

               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself.  Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return.



     Brian raises his hand and then stands.



                             BRIAN

               You know, I can answer that right

               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.

               'cause...



                             VERNON

               Sit down Johnson...



                             BRIAN

               Thank you sir...



     He sits.



                             VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points.



                             VERNON

               ...is right across that hall.  Any

               monkey business is ill-advised...



     He looks around at them.



                             VERNON

               ...any questions?



                             BENDER

               Yeah...I got a question.



     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.



                             BENDER

               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

               wardrobe?



                             VERNON

               I'll give you the answer to that

               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

               Don't mess with the bull young man,

               you'll get the horns.



     Vernon leaves.



                             BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is

     Allison, biting her nails.



     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is

     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.



                             BENDER

               You keep eating your hand and you're

               not gonna be hungry for lunch...



     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.



                             BENDER

               I've seen you before, you know...



     We see Vernon look out from his office.



     We see Brian playing with his pen.



                             BRIAN

               (quietly to himself)

               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

               Who are you?



     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip.



                             BRIAN

               I am a walrus...



     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices

     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--

     embarrassed.



     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the

     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing

     his jacket.



     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands

     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket

     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still

     staring at him.



                             BRIAN

               It's the shits, huh?



     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable

     laugh.



     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He

     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's

     head.



     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender.



     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a

     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”



                             CLAIRE

               (to herself)

               I can't believe this is really

               happening to me...



     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.



                             BENDER

               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss?



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Please...



                             BENDER

               If you gotta go...



     We hear Bender unzip his fly.



                             BENDER

               You gotta go!



     Everyone is now looking at Bender.



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Oh my God!



                             ANDREW

               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!



                             BENDER

               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

               it crawl back up!



                             ANDREW

               You whip it out and you're dead

               before the first drop hits the

               floor!



     Bender gasps mockingly.



                             BENDER

               You're pretty sexy when you get

               angry...grrr!



     He turns to Brian.



                             BENDER

               Hey, homeboy...



     Brian points at himself with his pen.



                             BENDER

               ...why don't you go close that door.

               We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated!



     Claire turns and glares at him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!



     Bender ignores him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!

                             BENDER

               What?



                             ANDREW

               If I lose my temper, you're totalled

               man!



                             BENDER

               Totally?



                             ANDREW

               Totally!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

               here is interested!



                             ANDREW

               Really!

               (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface!



                             BENDER

               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

               get in here?  Forget to wash your

               jock?



                             BRIAN

               (nervous)

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

               should just write our papers...



                             ANDREW

               (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off!



     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.



                             BENDER

               It's a free country...



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               of you!  Just ignore him...



                             BENDER

               (to Claire)

               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if

               you tried!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             BENDER

               So...so!

               (to Andrew and Claire)

               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-

               friend?

               (a beat)

               Steady dates?

               (another beat)

               Lo--vers?

               (another beat)

               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do

               you slip her the hot...beef...

               injection?



     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.



                             CLAIRE

               (screams)

               Go to hell!



                             ANDREW

               (screams)

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.



                             VERNON

               Coffee...looks like they scrape it

               off the bottom of the Mississippi

               river.  Everything's polluted,

               everything's polluted...the coffee.



     Bender comes out of the library doors followed

     bye veryone else.



     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.

     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the

     end of the line, Allison is following.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               How do you know where Vernon went?



                             BENDER

               I don't...



                             CLAIRE

               Well then, how do you know when he'll

               be back?



                             BENDER

               I don't...being bad feels pretty

               good, huh?



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               What's the point in going to Bender's

               locker?



                             ANDREW

               Beats me...



                             BRIAN

               This is so stupid...Why do you think,

               why are we risking getting caught?



                             ANDREW

               I dunno...



                             BRIAN

               So then what are we doing?



                             ANDREW

               You ask me one more question and I'm

               beating the shit out of you!



                             BRIAN

               Sorry...



     Bender opens his locker.



                             ANDREW

               Slob!



                             BENDER

               My maid's on vacation.



     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...



                             ANDREW

               Screw that Bender...put it back!



     Bender walks away.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.



     Claire walks after Bender.



                             BRIAN

               That was marijuana!



                             ANDREW

               Shut up!



     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison

     who is standing there with her mouth open.



                             BRIAN

               Do you approve of this?



     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of

     Bender's locker.



     We see the crowd walking down the hall.



                             BENDER

               We'll cross through the lab, and

               then we'll double back.



                             ANDREW

               You better be right, if Vernon cuts

               us off it's your fault, asshole!



                             BRIAN

               (to Claire)

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?



     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various

     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon

     until they stop.



                             BENDER

               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We

               have to go through the cafeteria!



                             ANDREW

               No, the activities hall.



                             BENDER

               Hey man, you don't know what you're

               talking about!



                             ANDREW

               No you don't know what you're

               talking about!



     Allison squeaks.



                             ANDREW

               Now we're through listening to you,

               we're going this way.



     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by

     an iron gate.



                             ANDREW

               Shit!



                             BENDER

               Great idea Jagoff!



                             ANDREW

               Fuck you!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to

               John?



                             BRIAN

               We're dead!



                             BENDER

               No, just me!



                             BRIAN

               What do you mean?



                             BENDER

               Get back to the library, keep your

               unit on this!



     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's

     underwear.



     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an

     airborne ranger...”



     We see Vernon hear Bender.



     The rest of them run.



                             VERNON

               That son of a bitch!



     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in

     the gym.



     Bender is going up for a basket.



                             BENDER

               Three...two...one!



     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.



                             VERNON

               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is

               this?  What are you doing here, what

               is this?



                             BENDER

               Oh, hi!



                             VERNON

               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's

               over!



                             BENDER

               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?



                             VERNON

               Out!



                             BENDER

               I'm thinking of trying out for a

               scholarship.



                             VERNON

               Gimmie the ball, Bender.



     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball

     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.



     They leave.

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================31====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================34====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that

     order on the railing.



                             CLAIRE

               Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah?



                             CLAIRE

               Are you gonna write your paper?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, why?



                             CLAIRE

               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of

               us to write our paper, don't you

               think?



                             BRIAN

               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us

               to do...



                             CLAIRE

               True, but I think we'd all kinda

               say the same thing.



                             BRIAN

               You just don't want to write your

               paper...Right?



                             CLAIRE

               True, but, you're the smartest,

               right?



                             BRIAN

               (with pride)

               Oh, well...



                             CLAIRE

               We trust you...



     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in

     approval.



                             ANDREW

               Yeah...



                             BRIAN

               All right, I'll do it...



                             CLAIRE

               Great...



     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Allison)

               Come on...



                             ALLISON

               Where're we going?



                             CLAIRE

               Come on!



     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.



                             CLAIRE

               Don't be afraid.



                             ALLISON

               Don't stick that in my eye!



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not sticking it, just close...

               just go like that...



     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.



                             CLAIRE

               Good...



     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.



                             CLAIRE

               You know you really do look a lot

               better without all that black shit

               on your eyes...



                             ALLISON

               Hey...I like that black shit...



                             CLAIRE

               This looks a lot better...look up.



     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.



     We see Andrew just thinking.



     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still

     putting make-up on Allison.



                             ALLISON

               Please, why're you being so nice to

               me?



                             CLAIRE

               'Cause you're letting me.



     We see Brian begin to write.



     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     The five are walking down the hall where they are met

     by Carl, sweeping up.  Brian nods at him.



                             CARL

               See ya Brian...



                             BRIAN

               Hey Carl...



                             BENDER

               (to Carl)

               See you next Saturday...



                             CARL

               You bet!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================5====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     There are six tables in two rows of three.

     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in

     and sits at the table behind her.



     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire

     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.



     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process.



     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to

     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian

     reluctantly gets up and moves.



     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up.



     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the

     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind

     Brian.



     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.



     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.



     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack

     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with

     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the

     job.



                             VERNON

               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

               to congradulate you for being on

               time...



     Claire raises her hand.



                             CLAIRE

               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

               been a mistake.  I know it's

               detention, but...um...I don't think

               I belong in here...



     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.



                             VERNON

               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

               exactly eight hours and fifty-four

               minutes to think about why you're

               here.  To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again.



     Claire looks like she is going to gag.



                             VERNON

               ...and you may not talk.  You will

               not move from these seats.



     He glances up at Bender and points at him.



                             VERNON

               ...and you...



     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.



                             VERNON

               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,

               we're gonna try something a little

               different today.  We are going to

               write an essay--of no less than a

               thousand words--describing to me

               who you think you are.



                             BENDER

               Is this a test?



     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice

     of Bender.



                             VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay.

               I do not mean a single word repeated

               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

               Bender?



     Bender looks up.



                             BENDER

               Crystal...



                             VERNON

               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself.  Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return.



     Brian raises his hand and then stands.



                             BRIAN

               You know, I can answer that right

               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.

               'cause...



                             VERNON

               Sit down Johnson...



                             BRIAN

               Thank you sir...



     He sits.



                             VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points.



                             VERNON

               ...is right across that hall.  Any

               monkey business is ill-advised...



     He looks around at them.



                             VERNON

               ...any questions?



                             BENDER

               Yeah...I got a question.



     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.



                             BENDER

               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

               wardrobe?



                             VERNON

               I'll give you the answer to that

               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

               Don't mess with the bull young man,

               you'll get the horns.



     Vernon leaves.



                             BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is

     Allison, biting her nails.



     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is

     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.



                             BENDER

               You keep eating your hand and you're

               not gonna be hungry for lunch...



     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.



                             BENDER

               I've seen you before, you know...



     We see Vernon look out from his office.



     We see Brian playing with his pen.



                             BRIAN

               (quietly to himself)

               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

               Who are you?



     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip.



                             BRIAN

               I am a walrus...



     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices

     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--

     embarrassed.



     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the

     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing

     his jacket.



     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands

     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket

     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still

     staring at him.



                             BRIAN

               It's the shits, huh?



     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable

     laugh.



     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He

     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's

     head.



     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender.



     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a

     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”



                             CLAIRE

               (to herself)

               I can't believe this is really

               happening to me...



     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.



                             BENDER

               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss?



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Please...



                             BENDER

               If you gotta go...



     We hear Bender unzip his fly.



                             BENDER

               You gotta go!



     Everyone is now looking at Bender.



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Oh my God!



                             ANDREW

               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!



                             BENDER

               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

               it crawl back up!



                             ANDREW

               You whip it out and you're dead

               before the first drop hits the

               floor!



     Bender gasps mockingly.



                             BENDER

               You're pretty sexy when you get

               angry...grrr!



     He turns to Brian.



                             BENDER

               Hey, homeboy...



     Brian points at himself with his pen.



                             BENDER

               ...why don't you go close that door.

               We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated!



     Claire turns and glares at him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!



     Bender ignores him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!

                             BENDER

               What?



                             ANDREW

               If I lose my temper, you're totalled

               man!



                             BENDER

               Totally?



                             ANDREW

               Totally!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

               here is interested!



                             ANDREW

               Really!

               (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface!



                             BENDER

               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

               get in here?  Forget to wash your

               jock?



                             BRIAN

               (nervous)

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

               should just write our papers...



                             ANDREW

               (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off!



     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.



                             BENDER

               It's a free country...



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               of you!  Just ignore him...



                             BENDER

               (to Claire)

               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if

               you tried!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             BENDER

               So...so!

               (to Andrew and Claire)

               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-

               friend?

               (a beat)

               Steady dates?

               (another beat)

               Lo--vers?

               (another beat)

               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do

               you slip her the hot...beef...

               injection?



     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.



                             CLAIRE

               (screams)

               Go to hell!



                             ANDREW

               (screams)

               Enough!

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.



                             VERNON

               Coffee...looks like they scrape it

               off the bottom of the Mississippi

               river.  Everything's polluted,

               everything's polluted...the coffee.



     Bender comes out of the library doors followed

     bye veryone else.



     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.

     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the

     end of the line, Allison is following.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               How do you know where Vernon went?



                             BENDER

               I don't...



                             CLAIRE

               Well then, how do you know when he'll

               be back?



                             BENDER

               I don't...being bad feels pretty

               good, huh?



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               What's the point in going to Bender's

               locker?



                             ANDREW

               Beats me...



                             BRIAN

               This is so stupid...Why do you think,

               why are we risking getting caught?



                             ANDREW

               I dunno...



                             BRIAN

               So then what are we doing?



                             ANDREW

               You ask me one more question and I'm

               beating the shit out of you!



                             BRIAN

               Sorry...



     Bender opens his locker.



                             ANDREW

               Slob!



                             BENDER

               My maid's on vacation.



     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...



                             ANDREW

               Screw that Bender...put it back!



     Bender walks away.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.



     Claire walks after Bender.



                             BRIAN

               That was marijuana!



                             ANDREW

               Shut up!



     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison

     who is standing there with her mouth open.



                             BRIAN

               Do you approve of this?



     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of

     Bender's locker.



     We see the crowd walking down the hall.



                             BENDER

               We'll cross through the lab, and

               then we'll double back.



                             ANDREW

               You better be right, if Vernon cuts

               us off it's your fault, asshole!



                             BRIAN

               (to Claire)

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?



     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various

     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon

     until they stop.



                             BENDER

               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We

               have to go through the cafeteria!



                             ANDREW

               No, the activities hall.



                             BENDER

               Hey man, you don't know what you're

               talking about!



                             ANDREW

               No you don't know what you're

               talking about!



     Allison squeaks.



                             ANDREW

               Now we're through listening to you,

               we're going this way.



     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by

     an iron gate.



                             ANDREW

               Shit!



                             BENDER

               Great idea Jagoff!



                             ANDREW

               Fuck you!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to

               John?



                             BRIAN

               We're dead!



                             BENDER

               No, just me!



                             BRIAN

               What do you mean?



                             BENDER

               Get back to the library, keep your

               unit on this!



     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's

     underwear.



     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an

     airborne ranger...”



     We see Vernon hear Bender.



     The rest of them run.



                             VERNON

               That son of a bitch!



     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in

     the gym.



     Bender is going up for a basket.



                             BENDER

               Three...two...one!



     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.



                             VERNON

               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is

               this?  What are you doing here, what

               is this?



                             BENDER

               Oh, hi!



                             VERNON

               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's

               over!



                             BENDER

               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?



                             VERNON

               Out!



                             BENDER

               I'm thinking of trying out for a

               scholarship.



                             VERNON

               Gimmie the ball, Bender.



     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball

     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.



     They leave.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     CUT TO:

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that

     order on the railing.



                             CLAIRE

               Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah?



                             CLAIRE

               Are you gonna write your paper?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, why?



                             CLAIRE

               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of

               us to write our paper, don't you

               think?



                             BRIAN

               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us

               to do...



                             CLAIRE

               True, but I think we'd all kinda

               say the same thing.



                             BRIAN

               You just don't want to write your

               paper...Right?



                             CLAIRE

               True, but, you're the smartest,

               right?



                             BRIAN

               (with pride)

               Oh, well...



                             CLAIRE

               We trust you...



     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in

     approval.



                             ANDREW

               Yeah...



                             BRIAN

               All right, I'll do it...



                             CLAIRE

               Great...



     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Allison)

               Come on...



                             ALLISON

               Where're we going?



                             CLAIRE

               Come on!



     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.



                             CLAIRE

               Don't be afraid.



                             ALLISON

               Don't stick that in my eye!



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not sticking it, just close...

               just go like that...



     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.



                             CLAIRE

               Good...



     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.



                             CLAIRE

               You know you really do look a lot

               better without all that black shit

               on your eyes...



                             ALLISON

               Hey...I like that black shit...



                             CLAIRE

               This looks a lot better...look up.



     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.



     We see Andrew just thinking.



     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still

     putting make-up on Allison.



                             ALLISON

               Please, why're you being so nice to

               me?



                             CLAIRE

               'Cause you're letting me.



     We see Brian begin to write.



     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     The five are walking down the hall where they are met

     by Carl, sweeping up.  Brian nods at him.



                             CARL

               See ya Brian...



                             BRIAN

               Hey Carl...



                             BENDER

               (to Carl)

               See you next Saturday...



                             CARL

               You bet!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================5====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     There are six tables in two rows of three.

     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in

     and sits at the table behind her.



     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire

     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.



     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process.



     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to

     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian

     reluctantly gets up and moves.



     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up.



     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the

     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind

     Brian.



     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.



     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.



     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack

     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with

     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the

     job.



                             VERNON

               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

               to congradulate you for being on

               time...



     Claire raises her hand.



                             CLAIRE

               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

               been a mistake.  I know it's

               detention, but...um...I don't think

               I belong in here...



     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.



                             VERNON

               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

               exactly eight hours and fifty-four

               minutes to think about why you're

               here.  To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again.



     Claire looks like she is going to gag.



                             VERNON

               ...and you may not talk.  You will

               not move from these seats.



     He glances up at Bender and points at him.



                             VERNON

               ...and you...



     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.



                             VERNON

               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,

               we're gonna try something a little

               different today.  We are going to

               write an essay--of no less than a

               thousand words--describing to me

               who you think you are.



                             BENDER

               Is this a test?



     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice

     of Bender.



                             VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay.

               I do not mean a single word repeated

               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

               Bender?



     Bender looks up.



                             BENDER

               Crystal...



                             VERNON

               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself.  Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return.



     Brian raises his hand and then stands.



                             BRIAN

               You know, I can answer that right

               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.

               'cause...



                             VERNON

               Sit down Johnson...



                             BRIAN

               Thank you sir...



     He sits.



                             VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points.



                             VERNON

               ...is right across that hall.  Any

               monkey business is ill-advised...



     He looks around at them.



                             VERNON

               ...any questions?



                             BENDER

               Yeah...I got a question.



     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.



                             BENDER

               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

               wardrobe?



                             VERNON

               I'll give you the answer to that

               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

               Don't mess with the bull young man,

               you'll get the horns.



     Vernon leaves.



                             BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is

     Allison, biting her nails.



     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is

     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.



                             BENDER

               You keep eating your hand and you're

               not gonna be hungry for lunch...



     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.



                             BENDER

               I've seen you before, you know...



     We see Vernon look out from his office.



     We see Brian playing with his pen.



                             BRIAN

               (quietly to himself)

               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

               Who are you?



     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip.



                             BRIAN

               I am a walrus...



     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices

     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--

     embarrassed.



     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the

     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing

     his jacket.



     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands

     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket

     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still

     staring at him.



                             BRIAN

               It's the shits, huh?



     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable

     laugh.



     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He

     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's

     head.



     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender.



     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a

     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”



                             CLAIRE

               (to herself)

               I can't believe this is really

               happening to me...



     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.



                             BENDER

               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss?



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Please...



                             BENDER

               If you gotta go...



     We hear Bender unzip his fly.



                             BENDER

               You gotta go!



     Everyone is now looking at Bender.



                             CLAIRE

               (disgusted)

               Oh my God!



                             ANDREW

               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!



                             BENDER

               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

               it crawl back up!



                             ANDREW

               You whip it out and you're dead

               before the first drop hits the

               floor!



     Bender gasps mockingly.



                             BENDER

               You're pretty sexy when you get

               angry...grrr!



     He turns to Brian.



                             BENDER

               Hey, homeboy...



     Brian points at himself with his pen.



                             BENDER

               ...why don't you go close that door.

               We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated!



     Claire turns and glares at him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!



     Bender ignores him.



                             ANDREW

               Hey!

                             BENDER

               What?



                             ANDREW

               If I lose my temper, you're totalled

               man!



                             BENDER

               Totally?



                             ANDREW

               Totally!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

               here is interested!



                             ANDREW

               Really!

               (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface!



                             BENDER

               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

               get in here?  Forget to wash your

               jock?



                             BRIAN

               (nervous)

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

               should just write our papers...



                             ANDREW

               (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off!



     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.



                             BENDER

               It's a free country...



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               of you!  Just ignore him...



                             BENDER

               (to Claire)

               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if

               you tried!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             BENDER

               So...so!

               (to Andrew and Claire)

               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-

               friend?

               (a beat)

               Steady dates?

               (another beat)

               Lo--vers?

               (another beat)

               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do

               you slip her the hot...beef...

               injection?



     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.



                             CLAIRE

               (screams)

               Go to hell!



                             ANDREW

               (screams)

               Enough!



     CUT TO:



========================================
====================20====================
     INT. HALLWAY - DAY



     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.



                             VERNON

               Coffee...looks like they scrape it

               off the bottom of the Mississippi

               river.  Everything's polluted,

               everything's polluted...the coffee.



     Bender comes out of the library doors followed

     bye veryone else.



     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.

     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the

     end of the line, Allison is following.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Bender)

               How do you know where Vernon went?



                             BENDER

               I don't...



                             CLAIRE

               Well then, how do you know when he'll

               be back?



                             BENDER

               I don't...being bad feels pretty

               good, huh?



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               What's the point in going to Bender's

               locker?



                             ANDREW

               Beats me...



                             BRIAN

               This is so stupid...Why do you think,

               why are we risking getting caught?



                             ANDREW

               I dunno...



                             BRIAN

               So then what are we doing?



                             ANDREW

               You ask me one more question and I'm

               beating the shit out of you!



                             BRIAN

               Sorry...



     Bender opens his locker.



                             ANDREW

               Slob!



                             BENDER

               My maid's on vacation.



     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...



                             ANDREW

               Screw that Bender...put it back!



     Bender walks away.



                             BRIAN

               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.



     Claire walks after Bender.



                             BRIAN

               That was marijuana!



                             ANDREW

               Shut up!



     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison

     who is standing there with her mouth open.



                             BRIAN

               Do you approve of this?



     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of

     Bender's locker.



     We see the crowd walking down the hall.



                             BENDER

               We'll cross through the lab, and

               then we'll double back.



                             ANDREW

               You better be right, if Vernon cuts

               us off it's your fault, asshole!



                             BRIAN

               (to Claire)

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?



     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various

     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon

     until they stop.



                             BENDER

               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We

               have to go through the cafeteria!



                             ANDREW

               No, the activities hall.



                             BENDER

               Hey man, you don't know what you're

               talking about!



                             ANDREW

               No you don't know what you're

               talking about!



     Allison squeaks.



                             ANDREW

               Now we're through listening to you,

               we're going this way.



     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by

     an iron gate.



                             ANDREW

               Shit!



                             BENDER

               Great idea Jagoff!



                             ANDREW

               Fuck you!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to

               John?



                             BRIAN

               We're dead!



                             BENDER

               No, just me!



                             BRIAN

               What do you mean?



                             BENDER

               Get back to the library, keep your

               unit on this!



     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's

     underwear.



     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an

     airborne ranger...”



     We see Vernon hear Bender.



     The rest of them run.



                             VERNON

               That son of a bitch!



     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in

     the gym.



     Bender is going up for a basket.



                             BENDER

               Three...two...one!



     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.



                             VERNON

               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is

               this?  What are you doing here, what

               is this?



                             BENDER

               Oh, hi!



                             VERNON

               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's

               over!



                             BENDER

               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?



                             VERNON

               Out!



                             BENDER

               I'm thinking of trying out for a

               scholarship.



                             VERNON

               Gimmie the ball, Bender.



     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball

     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.



     They leave.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     CUT TO:



========================================
====================31====================
     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.



                             ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks?

               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I

               had to...



                             CLAIRE

               That's boring...



                             ANDREW

               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?



                             CLAIRE

               The idea is to like search your mind

               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

               would you drive to school naked?



     Andrew laughs.



                             ANDREW

               Um, uh...would I have to get out of

               the car?



                             CLAIRE

               Of course...



                             ANDREW

               In the spring, or winter?



                             CLAIRE

               It doesn't matter...spring...



                             ANDREW

               In front of the school or in back

               of the school?



                             CLAIRE

               Either one...



                             ANDREW

               Yes...



                             ALLISON

               I'd do that!



     They all look at her.



                             ALLISON

               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

               need a million dollars to do it

               either...



                             CLAIRE

               You're lying...



                             ALLISON

               I already have...I've done just

               about everything there is except a

               few things that are illegal...I'm a

               nymphomaniac!



     Claire rolls her eyes.



                             CLAIRE

               Lie...



                             BRIAN

               Are your parents aware of this?



                             ALLISON

               The only person I told was my

               shrink...



                             ANDREW

               And what'd he do when you told him?



                             ALLISON

               He nailed me...



                             CLAIRE

               Very nice...



                             ALLISON

               I don't think that from a legal

               standpoint what he did can be

               construed as rape since I paid him.



                             CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                             CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                             ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                             CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                             ALLISON

               Sure...



                             CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                             BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                             ALLISON

               (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                             ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                             CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                             BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                             CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                             ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                             CLAIRE

               A what?



                             ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                             CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                             ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                             ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                             BENDER

               (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                             ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                             ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                             ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                             CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                             BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                             BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                             CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                             BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                             BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                             CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                             BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                             BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                             ANDREW

               Be honest...



                             BENDER

               No big deal...



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                             ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                             BENDER

               Talk to us!



                             ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                             BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                             CLAIRE

               (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                             ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                             CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                             ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                             CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                             ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                             ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                             ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                             ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                             BRIAN

               (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                             ANDREW

               (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                             ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                             CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                             ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

               (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                             BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                             BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                             CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                             BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                             BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                             BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                             BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                             BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                             BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                             BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                             BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                             BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                             BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                             ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                             CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                             ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                             BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                             CLAIRE

               (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                             ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                             BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                             CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                             BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                             CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                             BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



     Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                             ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                             CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                             BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                             ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                             BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                             ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                             BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

               (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                             CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                             BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

               (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.



                             CLAIRE

               (quietly)

               Shut up...



                             BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                             CLAIRE

               (angry)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER                       

               I bet they are...did you

               work, for the money               

               for those earrings?                   

          

                             CLAIRE

               Shut...

               Your mouth!



                             BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                             CLAIRE

               (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                             BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                             ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                             CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                             ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                             CLAIRE

               What happens?



                             ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                             BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                             ALLISON

               I care...



                             BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                             ANDREW

               No...



                             BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                             CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah...



                             CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                             CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                             ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                             CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                             ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                             CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                             ANDREW

               No way!



                             ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                             CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                             BENDER

               (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                             CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                             BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                             CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                             BENDER

               (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                             CLAIRE

               (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                             BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                             CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                             BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                             BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

               (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                             ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                             BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                             ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                             BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                             CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                             BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                             CLAIRE

               (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                             BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                             CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                             BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                             BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                             ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                             BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                             ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                             ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                             BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                             CLAIRE

               (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                             BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                             CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                             BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                             ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                             BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                             ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                             BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                             BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                             ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                             ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                             ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                             ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that

     order on the railing.



                             CLAIRE

               Brian?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah?



                             CLAIRE

               Are you gonna write your paper?



                             BRIAN

               Yeah, why?



                             CLAIRE

               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of

               us to write our paper, don't you

               think?



                             BRIAN

               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us

               to do...



                             CLAIRE

               True, but I think we'd all kinda

               say the same thing.



                             BRIAN

               You just don't want to write your

               paper...Right?



                             CLAIRE

               True, but, you're the smartest,

               right?



                             BRIAN

               (with pride)

               Oh, well...



                             CLAIRE

               We trust you...



     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in

     approval.



                             ANDREW

               Yeah...



                             BRIAN

               All right, I'll do it...



                             CLAIRE

               Great...



     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.



                             CLAIRE

               (to Allison)

               Come on...



                             ALLISON

               Where're we going?



                             CLAIRE

               Come on!



     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.



                             CLAIRE

               Don't be afraid.



                             ALLISON

               Don't stick that in my eye!



                             CLAIRE

               I'm not sticking it, just close...

               just go like that...



     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.



                             CLAIRE

               Good...



     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.



                             CLAIRE

               You know you really do look a lot

               better without all that black shit

               on your eyes...



                             ALLISON

               Hey...I like that black shit...



                             CLAIRE

               This looks a lot better...look up.



     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.



     We see Andrew just thinking.



     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still

     putting make-up on Allison.



                             ALLISON

               Please, why're you being so nice to

               me?



                             CLAIRE

               'Cause you're letting me.



     We see Brian begin to write.



     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     The five are walking down the hall where they are met

     by Carl, sweeping up.  Brian nods at him.
