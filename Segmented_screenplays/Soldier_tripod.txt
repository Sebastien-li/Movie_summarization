====================35====================
     INT.  "STATION" - DAY



     The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK,

     and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the

     muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but

     not desperately.



                                   MEKUM

                    Of course, age is a factor, but the

                    real factor is the training program,

                    especially the psychological.  The

                    mind controls the body after all,

                    and we're doing wonderful things

                    with the mind.



     A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer,

     takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at

     the same pace, his face like stone.



     TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, 

     comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes.



                                   TODD

                    Sir.



                                   RUBRICK

                    At ease, soldier.



     CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM.



                                   CHURCH

                    What's the price of all that speed?

                    Is he tired?

                                   MEKUM

                    Tired?



                                   CHURCH

                    Todd here ran the pace he's been

                    taught to run.  He's still strong.

                    Send him up the chain, Rube.



                                   RUBRICK

                    (to Todd)

                    Soldier!  Up the chain!

                                   TODD

                    Sir.



     TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the

     rafters sixty feet above, grabs one, and starts up it, hand over

     hand.



     MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at

     him expectantly.



     MEKUM grins at CHURCH.



     Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying.



     TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch

     circular "platforms" or footholds in the chain every ten feet.

                                   MEKUM

                    (sharply)

                    Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!



                                   MELTON

                    (saluting)

                    Sir!



     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid-

     stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.



     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men

     struggle upward toward the rafters.



     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then

     passes him.

     MEKUM, watching, smirks.



     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow

     is knit, something's bothering him.



     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS



     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty

     feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.



     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a

     "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.



     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up,

     three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches,

     neither man reveals anything at all...



     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP



     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.



                                   CHURCH

                    What about...spirit?



                                   MEKUM

                    (as in "what's that?")

                    Spirit?

                    (...a grin)

                    Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive

                    qualities"?



                                   CHURCH

                    Whatever the latest jargon is.



                                   MEKUM

                    Much better, much higher.  For

                    example, where your old ones

                    expressed ninety percent of their

                    sexual energy in aggressive

                    physicality, these new ones are

                    ninety-nine percent without

                    sexual inclination.  It's all

                    aggression.



                                   SLOAN

                    (dryly)

                    Real men!



                                   CHURCH

                    (sharply, to Sloan)

                    At ease, Lieutenant.

                    (turning to Mekum,

                    serious)

                    What if they fought?



     A sudden silence.



     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.



     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up.

                                   MEKUM

                    You mean up there?



                                   CHURCH

                    (to Rubrick)

                    Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take

                    him.

                                   MEKUM

                    No!



     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new 

     soldiers can't fight?



                                   CHURCH

                    "No"?

                                   MEKUM

                    Not fair.  No contest.  Send two

                    more of your old ones up.



     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a

     glance.



                                   MEKUM

                    Go ahead.



     RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in

     a group on the cement floor.



                                   RUBRICK

                    Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up

                    the chains.



     Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their

     feet and climb rapidly.



     SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks 

     confidently.



     ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE.  They're still facing each other

     across the sixty foot drop.



     MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.



     ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. 

     They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.



     Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight

     motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the 

     veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.



     TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.



     ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW



     For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling

     around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.

                                   RUBRICK

                    Get him, men!



     ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he

     starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his

     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,

     slides...



     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!

     MELTON hits him again, hard.



     GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with

     his free hand and with both feet.



     MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the

     face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes 

     mercilessly.



     ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold

     on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks

     up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly

     hurl ROMERO downward.



     ROMERO rockets down past TODD...



     ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the 

     cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them

     with blood.



     Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up

     again...



     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's

     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!

     GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, 

     swings after him.



     ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.

     His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and

     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.



     Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him

     hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...



     ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a "platform" foothold on his

     chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down

     on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,

     then...



     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one

     arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free

     hand and strangling him with the other arm.



     MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.



     ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of

     concern wrinkles his brow.



     ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.

     MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps

     for air, but...



     GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...



     MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips

     him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward

     even as...



     TODD goes for face with his free hand.



     SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.



     TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.



     ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of

     MELTON's injury.



     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank

     impassive faces, RILEY among them.



     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.



     ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's

     elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of

     him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.



     MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites 

     furiously, drawing blood.



     TODD grits his teeth in pain.



     WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.



     TODD is losing his grip.



     RILEY watches below, his face a mask.



     MELTON bites and elbows furiously.



     TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins

     to fall and then...



     Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it

     ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand

     for twenty feet until...



     He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet

     to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of

     ROMERO's broken body below.



     Sudden silence!



     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies

     motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.



     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.



     ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.



     It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one-

     eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...

                                   MEKUM

                    GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE

                    DOUBLE, GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE, YOU

                    MISERABLE PISS ANT STINKING SHIT FOR

                    BRAINS!



     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to

     MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the

     chain fast...

                                   MELTON

                    COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN,

                    DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE

                    SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN!



     MELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet,

     landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes.



                                   MELTON

                    Sir!



                                   MEKUM

                    LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT,

                    YOU'VE LOST AN EYE.  WHAT THE HELL

                    GOOD IS A GODDAMN ONE-EYED SOLDIER?

                    DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COST TO BREED

                    YOU, YOU BIG MORON?  TO TRAIN YOU,

                    FEED YOU?



     As MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing

     tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices.



                                   RUBRICK

                    They're...fantastic!



                                   CHURCH

                    (reluctant agreement)

                    Mmmmmmm...



                                   SLOAN

                    (worried)

                    We could have a problem here,

                    couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost

                    three men...



                                   CHURCH

                    Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

                    "Training accident."  Paperwork.



                                   SLOAN

                    What about the bodies?



                                   CHURCH

                    (turning away)

                    Incinerator.



     Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM

     who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW

     SOLDIERS.



                                   MEKUM

                    WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE

                    GOOD EYE!  HE'S GOT NO DEPTH PERCEPTION!

                    HE'S CANNON FODDER.  ALL HE CAN DO

                    IS WALK POINT AND TAKE THE FIRST

                    HIT.



                                   CHURCH

                    (interrupting)

                    They're very...impressive.



                                   MEKUM

                    (fuming)

                    Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't

                    have lost an eye.



     CHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body,

     tries to assuage him.



                                   CHURCH

                    It was our best man who got his

                    eye...  Todd, a real tough one.

                    Survived police action in Montana,

                    fought in the Argentine Sector, and

                    in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing

                    of --

                                   MEKUM

                    Old news!  They're nothing at all!

                    Wait until you get these new fellas

                    into some real action.  I guarantee

                    you'll be awed.  I guarantee it.



     The NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them,

     staring right at the VETERANS.



     Not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we...



     CUT TO:

     EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH



     WHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long

     moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons

     that aren't clear.



     Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.



     In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of

     a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him

     from the wind howling overhead.



     TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he

     slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and 

     injured even to crawl.



     Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly

     sees something.



     Shoes!  Less than a foot from his bloody face.



     He manages to lift his head a little and look up.



     Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench

     wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and 

     JOHNNY, eight.



     Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on

     their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in

     amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps

     unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...



     CUT TO:

====================109====================
     EXT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE



     Two ominous NEW SOLDIERS wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor

     under their uniforms hang on the outside of the CRAWLER in the

     wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big

     rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward

     the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly

     forward through the litter, an evil vision.

     INT.  CORRIDOR



     Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, 

     weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers

     after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid 

     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.



                                   SANDRA

                    Sergeant Todd!



     ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps

     ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.



========================================
====================223====================
     EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" - NIGHT



     RUBRICK desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage

     wind tears at him...but he can't hold on.



     As SLOAN and CHURCH are shoved out the hatch, they see RUBRICK

     blown off into the night, screaming.



                                   CHURCH

                    DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT!



     And CHURCH dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him.



     SLOAN does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them, 

     shutting them out of the ship..



                                   SLOAN

                    NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO!
